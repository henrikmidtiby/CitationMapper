AB A selective applicator for post-emergence herbicides in row crops was
   developed and tested.  Weed competition is sensed using a modulated,
   NIR light source and phototransistor receiver.  A logic circuit for
   activating a solenoid valve at the spray nozzle was also constructed. 
   Preliminary results indicate herbicide savings of 15% with no adverse
   effect on weed control.
