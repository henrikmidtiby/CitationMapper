AB Weeds are frequently distributed non-uniformly within fields. 
   Herbicide use could be reduced either by applying it only to
   weed-infested areas or by applying a low dose rate to the whole field
   and normal dose rate to weed patches.  A necessary prerequisite is an
   effective method of weed detection.  Tractor-mounted detectors do not
   appear to be feasible.  Thus real-time weed detection and sprayer
   control are not currently possible.  It is shown, however, that
   spatially variable herbicide application using a sprayer location
   system and a field map of weed location has potential.  The data map
   would be constructed from a number of weed-location techniques based on
   image analysis, such as tractor-mounted video cameras, aerial
   photographs and manual field observation.
