AB Wheat, Triticum durum L, is a major cereal crop in Spain with over five
   million ha grown annually. Wild oat, Avena sterilis L., and canary
   grass, Phalaris spp., are distributed only in patches in wheat fields
   but herbicides are applied over entire fields, thus leading to
   over-application and unnecessary pollution. To reduce herbicide
   application, site-specific management techniques based on weed maps are
   being developed to treat only weed patches. Intensive weed scouting
   from the ground is time-consuming and expensive, and it relies on
   estimates of weeds at unsampled points. Remote sensing of weed canopies
   has been shown to be a more efficient alternative. The principle of
   weed remote sensing is that there are differences in the spectral
   reflectance between weeds and crops. To test this principle, we studied
   spectral signatures taken on the ground in the visible and
   near-infrared windows for discriminating wheat, wild oat and canary
   grass at their last phenological stages. Late-season phenological
   stages included initial seed maturation through advanced maturation for
   weeds, and initial senescence to senescent for wheat. Spectral
   signatures were collected on eight sampling dates from April 28 through
   May 26 using a handheld field spectroradiometer. A stepwise
   discriminant analysis was used to detect differences in reflectance and
   to determine the accuracy performance for a species classification as
   affected by their phenological stage. Four scenarios or classification
   sets were considered: wheat-wild oat-canary grass, with each species
   represented by a different group of spectra; wheat and grass weeds,
   combining the two weed species into one spectral group; wheat and wild
   oat with each represented as a single group, and finally, wheat and
   canary grass. Our analysis achieved 100% classification accuracy at the
   phenological stages of initial seed maturation, and green and advanced
   seed maturation and partly green for weeds and wheat, respectively,
   between the dates of April 28 and May 6. Furthermore, we reduced the
   number of hyperspectral wavelengths to thirteen out of 50.
   Multispectral analysis also showed that broad wavebands corresponding
   to those of QuickBird satellite imagery discriminated wild oat, canary
   grass and wheat at the same phenological stages and dates. Our findings
   are very useful for determining the timeframe during which future
   multispectral QuickBird satellite images will be obtained and the
   concrete wavelengths that should be used in case of using airborne
   hyperspectral imaging. Accurate and timely mapping of the spatial
   distribution of weeds is a key element in achieving site-specific
   herbicide applications for reducing spraying volume of herbicides and
   costs.

AB The potential impact of herbicide utilization compel people to use new
   method of weed control. Selective herbicide application is optimal
   method to reduce herbicide usage while maintain weed control. The key
   of selective herbicide is how to discriminate weed exactly. The HIS
   color co-occurrence method (CCM) texture analysis techniques was used
   to extract four texture parameters: Angular second moment (ASM),
   Entropy(E), Inertia quadrature (IQ), and Inverse difference moment or
   local homogeneity (IDM). The weed species selected for studying were
   Arthraxon hispidus, Digitaria sanguinalis, Petunia, Cyperus,
   Alternanthera Philoxeroides and Corchoropsis psilocarpa. The software
   of neuroshell2 was used for designing the structure of the neural
   network, training and test the data. It was found that the 8-40-1
   artificial neural network provided the best classification performance
   and was capable of classification accuracies of 78%.

AB Selective application of herbicide in agricultural cropping systems
   provides both economic and environmental benefits. Implementation of
   this technology requires knowledge of the location and density of weed
   species within a crop. In this study, two image classification
   techniques (neural networks and maximum likelihood) are compared for
   accuracy in weed/crop species discrimination. In the summer of 2005,
   high spatial resolution (1.25mm) ground-based hyperspectral image data
   were acquired over field plots of three crop species (canola, peas, and
   wheat) seeded with weeds, either redroot pigweed or wild oat. Neural
   network (NN) and maximum likelihood (MLC) classifiers were applied to
   these image data for comparison of accuracy in species discrimination.
   Both techniques preformed well in classifying single weed/crop mixtures
   with overall accuracies ranging from 92-97% and 88-96% using NN and
   MLC, respectively. NN classification accuracy showed slight
   improvements over MLC in all cases.

AB Site-Specific Herbicide Management (SSHM) in Precision Agriculture (PA)
   requires weed detection in crop fields for directed herbicide
   application instead of spraying entire fields. This has significant
   economic and environmental advantages for improved agricultural
   practices that are essential given forecast increases in global
   population and food production needs. In this study, a new hybrid
   segmentation - Artificial Neural Network (HS-ANN) method was compared
   to standard Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) for improving
   crop/weed species discrimination in SSHM/PA. Very high spatial
   resolution (1.25 mm) ground-based hyperspectral image data were
   acquired over field plots of canola, pea, and wheat crops seeded with
   two weed species (redroot pigweed, wild oat) in southern Alberta,
   Canada. The very high spatial and spectral resolution image data
   required development of a simple yet efficient vegetation index
   (Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (MCARI))
   threshold segmentation to separate vegetation from soil for
   classification. The HS-ANN consistently outperformed MLC in both single
   date and multi-temporal classifications. Higher class accuracies were
   obtained with multi-temporally trained ANNS (84 to 92 percent overall),
   with improvements up to 31 percent over MLC. With advancements in
   imaging technology and computer processing speed, this HS-ANN method
   may constitute a viable farm option for real-time detection and mapping
   of weed species for SSHM in agriculture.

AB Grain yield often varies within agricultural fields as a result of the
   variation in soil characteristics, competition from weeds, management
   practices and their causal interactions. To implement appropriate
   management decisions, yield variability needs to be explained and
   quantified. A new experimental design was established and tested in a
   field experiment to detect yield variation in relation to the variation
   in soil quality, the heterogeneity of weed distribution and weed
   control within a field. Weed seedling distribution and density,
   apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) and grain yield were
   recorded and mapped in a 3.5 ha winter wheat field during 2005 and
   2006. A linear mixed model with an anisotropic spatial correlation
   structure was used to estimate the effect of soil characteristics, weed
   competition and herbicide treatment on crop yield. The results showed
   that all properties had a strong effect on grain yield. By adding
   herbicide costs and current grain price into the model, thresholds of
   weed density were derived for site-specific weed control. This
   experimental approach enables the variation of yield within
   agricultural fields to be explained, and an understanding of the
   effects on yield of the factors that affect it and their causal
   interactions to be gained. The approach can be applied to improve
   decision algorithms for the patch spraying of weeds.

AB Autonomous robotic weed control systems hold promise toward the
   automation of one of agriculture's few remaining unmechanized and
   drudging tasks, hand weed control. Robotic technology may also provide
   a means of reducing agriculture's current dependency on herbicides,
   improving its sustainability and reducing its environmental impact.
   This review describes the current status of the four core technologies
   (guidance, detection and identification, precision in-row weed control,
   and mapping) required for the successful development of a
   general-purpose robotic system for weed control. Of the four, detection
   and identification of weeds under the wide range of conditions common
   to agricultural fields remains the greatest challenge. A few complete
   robotic weed control systems have demonstrated the potential of the
   technology in the field. Additional research and development is needed
   to fully realize this potential. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Field studies were conducted to determine the potential of
   multispectral classification of late-season grass weeds in wheat.
   Several classification techniques have been used to discriminate
   differences in reflectance between wheat and Avena sterilis, Phalaris
   brachystachys, Lolium rigidum and Polypogon monspeliensis in the
   400-900 nm spectrum, and to evaluate the accuracy of performance for a
   spectral signature classification into the plant species or group to
   which it belongs. Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, nonparametric
   functional discriminant analysis and several neural networks have been
   applied, either with a preliminary principal component analysis (PCA)
   or not and in different scenarios. Fisher's linear discriminant
   analysis, feedforward neural networks and one-layer neural network, all
   showed classification percentages between 90% and 100% with PCA.
   Generally, a preliminary computation of the most relevant principal
   components considerably improves the correct classification percentage.
   These results are promising because A. sterilis and L. rigidum, two of
   the most problematic, clearly patchy and expensive-to-control weeds in
   wheat, could be successfully discriminated from wheat in the 400-900 nm
   range. Our results suggest that mapping grass weed patches in wheat
   could be feasible with analysis of real-time and high-resolution
   satellite imagery acquired in mid-May under these conditions.

AB Weed is one of the important factors, which damages the quality of the
   agricultural products. At present the method to weed is to spray the
   herbicide and the means to spray is the well-distributed spraying. This
   method not only improves the cost of agriculture but also damages the
   quality of field and pollutes air.
   The study on infield weed detection using machine vision is significant
   to reduce herbicide dosage and environment pollution by applying the
   variable-rate spraying. The paper studied the method to detect the
   inter-row weed based on image processing technology. Firstly, applying
   color feature increased the contrast between green plants and soil,
   separated the plants from complex background, changed real color image
   to gray-level image and pre processed the image to remove the noise.
   Secondly, some algorithms of image threshold segmentation were
   researched and selected a suitable segmentation method, namely changing
   threshold segmentation. The algorithms could transfer gray-level image
   into binary image with stabilization and no distortion. Finally, we
   studied the BPNN (Backpropagation NN) which was used to detect the weed
   using the functions provided by MATLAB, and had many training and
   imitation. The results of the experiment. showed that in order to
   improve the rate of identified the weed properly and built up the
   stable foundation of the further research, the training times and the
   rate of sample learning and identifying should be considered in the net
   structure.

AB Field research was conducted to determine the potential of
   hyperspectral and multispectral imagery for late-season discrimination
   and mapping of grass weed infestations in wheat. Differences in
   reflectance between weed-free wheat and wild oat, canarygrass, and
   ryegrass were statistically significant in most 25-nm-wide wavebands in
   the 400- and 900-nm spectrum, mainly due to their differential
   maturation. Visible (blue, B; green, G; red, R) and near infrared (NIR)
   wavebands and five vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index (NDVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), R/B, NIR-R and (R - G)/(R +
   G), showed potential for discriminating grass weeds and wheat. The
   efficiency of these wavebands and indices were studied by using color
   and color-infrared aerial images taken over three naturally infested
   fields. In StaCruz, areas infested with wild oat and canarygrass
   patches were discriminated using the indices R, NIR, and NDVI with
   overall accuracies (OA) of 0.85 to 0.90. In Florida-West, areas
   infested with wild oat, canarygrass, and ryegrass were discriminated
   with OA from 0.85 to 0.89. In Florida-East, for the discrimination of
   the areas infested with wild oat patches, visible wavebands and several
   vegetation indices provided OA of 0.87 to 0.96. Estimated grass weed
   area ranged from 56 to 71%, 43 to 47%, and 69 to 80% of the field in
   the three locations, respectively, with per-class accuracies from 0.87
   to 0.94. NDVI was the most efficient vegetation index, with a highly
   accurate performance in all locations. Our results Suggest that mapping
   grass weed patches in wheat is feasible with high-resolution satellite
   imagery or aerial photography acquired 2 to 3 wk before crop senescence.

AB Ridolfia segetum is an umbelliferous weed frequent and abundant in
   sunflower crops in the Mediterranean basin. Field research was
   conducted to evaluate the potential of hyperspectral and multispectral
   reflectance and five vegetation indices in the visible to near infrared
   spectral range, for discriminating bare soil, sunflower and R. segetum
   at different phenological stages. This was a preliminary step for
   mapping R. segetum patches in sunflower using remote sensing for
   herbicide application decisions. Reflectance data were collected at
   three sampling dates (mid-May, mid-June and mid-July, corresponding to
   vegetative-early reproductive, flowering and senescent phenological
   stages respectively) using a handheld field spectroradiometer.
   Differences observed in hyperspectral reflectance curves were
   statistically significant within and between crop and weed phenological
   stages depending on sampling date, which facilitates their
   discrimination. Statistically significant differences in the
   multispectral and vegetation indices analysis showed that it is also
   possible to distinguish any of the classes studied. Our study provides
   some information for constructing the spectral libraries of sunflower
   and R. segetum in which the different phenological stages co-existing
   in the field were considered. Hyperspectral and multispectral results
   suggest that mapping R. segetum patches in sunflower is feasible using
   airborne hyperspectral sensors, and high-resolution satellite imagery
   or aerial photography, respectively, taking into account specific
   timeframes.

AB The commercial use of agricultural remote sensing to improve farm
   management is closer to becoming a reality. Officially opened and
   dedicated in April 2001, the Illinois Laboratory for Agricultural
   Remote Sensing (ILARS) located at the University of Illinois in
   Urbana-Champaign is bringing together research experts in crop
   sciences, agricultural engineering, biotechnology, precision farming
   and information systems to develop "real world" applications of remote
   sensing. Among future research endeavors, ILARS scientists envision the
   development of high-accuracy remote sensing systems for precision
   agriculture application. This paper summarizes major current projects
   in the Illinois Laboratory for Agricultural Remote Sensing at

AB The potential environmental impact of herbicide utilisation has
   stimulated research into new methods of weed control. Selective
   herbicide application offers the possibility to reduce herbicide usage
   while maintaining weed control. The research reported utilised colour
   co-occurrence method (CCM) texture analysis techniques to evaluate
   three different neural-network classifiers for potential use in
   real-time weed control systems. An image data set consisting of 33
   unique texture features for each image in a six class data set (40
   images per class) was generated for the following classes; foxtail,
   crabgrass, common lambsquarter, velvetleaf, morning-glory, and clear
   soil surface. The data sets were evaluated using a stepwise variable
   selection procedure to provide six unique data models separated
   according to hue-saturation-intensity colour features. A comparison
   study of the classification capabilities of three neural-network models
   (backpropagation, counterpropagation, and radial basis function) was
   conducted. It was found that the backpropagation neural-network
   classifier provided the best classification performance and was capable
   of classification accuracies of 97%, which exceeded traditional
   statistical classification procedure accuracy of 93%. When comparing
   the three neural-network methodologies, the backpropagation method not
   only achieved a higher classification accuracy, but also had less
   computational requirements. (c) 2005 Silsoe Research Institute. All

AB Precision weed management technology has immense potential for treating
   weed species at a small scale. To this end, however, crop and weeds
   must be recognized. One approach to this involves identification of
   reflectance signatures of crops and weeds that differ in the visible
   and near-infrared (NIR) wavelength region. Reflectance spectra were
   used for the detection of cheat (Bromus secalinus L.), ryegrass (Lolium
   multiflorum Lam.), and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under
   greenhouse conditions. A total of three experiments (two in December
   2002 and one in February 2003) were conducted at the Agronomy Research
   Station, Stillwater, OK. The three species and two N levels were
   arranged in a completely randomized design with three replications.
   Spectral readings were taken at Feekes 3 and 5 winter wheat growth
   stages with a spectrometer. Two spectral measurements were obtained
   from each pot. The spectral measurements from the three experiments
   were combined by the two growth stages because preliminary analysis
   revealed that date of measurement and N levels were not significant.
   The spectral readings were measured at 1-nm intervals and averaged into
   10-mn bandwidths for the wavelengths from 400 to 865 mn. Data were
   analyzed using a discriminant analysis procedure. The discriminant
   function with the band combinations 515/675, 555/675, and 805/815
   resulted in the best overall correct classification (94%) of
   observations at Feekes 3, while for spectral data at Feekes 5 the
   discriminant function with the band combinations 755 and 855/675
   resulted in 66.7% overall correct classification of observations. In
   several instances, ryegrass was classified as either cheat or winter
   wheat, while cheat was classified as rye. Cheat was not classified as
   winter wheat in most instances. This suggests that it is possible to
   identify cheat in winter wheat using wavelength ratios developed from
   spectral readings in 10-nm bands between 500 and 860 mn.

AB The objective of this work was to develop a fast and practical method
   of weed seedbank evaluation to generate spatially distributed maps for
   use in site-specific weed management. Soil cores were collected at 0.20
   m depth, air-dried, and then submitted to seedling growth in
   greenhouse. The sampling grid of 20 by 20 m was georeferenced by Global
   Positioning System, obtaining 73 soil cores with three replicates.
   During the greenhouse trial, there were two peaks of weed seedling
   growth: one in 119 days after water irrigation and another after KNO3
   application. Weeds seedbank maps were obtained at different stages of
   seedling growth. The Pearson correlation was 0.99 for Brachiaria
   plantaginea seedbank map, 0.95 for Commelina benghalensis, and 0.85 for
   Cyperus rotudus generated at 119 days compared with 392 days after
   seedling growth in the greenhouse. The Brachiaria plantaginea seedbank
   map evaluated at 35 days presented correlation of 0.97 with 392 days.
   It was concluded that, for site-specific weed seedbank management, the
   evaluation of seedling growth in greenhouse until the first emergence
   peak is enough to generate weed seedbank maps.

AB For planning non-real time weed control the distribution of weed
   species on the field to be treated should be known, therefore the
   elaboration of weed maps is necessary. After the pre-emergence
   treatments the remaining perennial weeds could be controlled
   efficiently and in a cost-effective way with precision post emergence
   treatments. For accurate mapping of perennial weed species the grid
   sampling method is not suitable. The distribution of perennial weed
   species was investigated on a 18 ha field part with a DGPS receiver.
   Positions, perimeter and area of weed patches larger than 1-2 m(2) of
   the found perennial weeds (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop., Convolvulus
   arvensis L., Polygonum amphibium L., Asclepias syriaca L.) were
   registered with submeter accuracy. Data were grouped according to the
   size of the weed patches, the rate of weed infection of the field was
   defined and weed distribution was illustrated on maps. With the use of
   these maps a stubble treatment could be performed, and further
   population dynamics investigations are facilitated on basis of these
   data.

AB The objective of this research was to assess the accuracy of remote
   sensing for detecting weed species in soybean based on two primary
   criteria: the presence or absence of weeds and the identification of
   individual weed species. Treatments included weeds (giant foxtail and
   velvetleaf) grown in monoculture or interseeded with soybean, bare
   ground, and weed-free soybean. Aerial multispectral digital images were
   collected at or near soybean canopy closure from two field sites in
   2001. Weedy pixels (1.3 m(2)) were separated from weed-free soybean and
   bare ground with no more than 11% error, depending on the site.
   However, the classification of weed species varied between sites. At
   one site, velvetleaf and giant foxtail were classified with no more
   than 17% error, when monoculture and interseeded plots were combined.
   However, classification errors were as high as 39% for velvetleaf and
   17% for giant foxtail at the other site. Our results support the idea
   that remote sensing has potential for weed detection in soybean,
   particularly when weed management systems do not require
   differentiation among weed species. Additional research is needed to
   characterize the effect of weed density or cover and crop-weed
   phenology on classification accuracies.

AB Weed control effectiveness and herbicide savings were determined for a
   variable-rate technology (VRT) herbicide application scenario involving
   three rates, including 100, 67 and 33% rates. Four herbicide
   treatments, including the VRT scenario and three blanket applications,
   were tested over a plot of soya beans with a severe weed problem. In
   the comparison of VRT and conventional methods, the former achieved the
   best performance in terms of weed control effectiveness and herbicide
   use efficiency. However, the particular rate scenario used for VRT
   applications was shown to have flaws. Specifically, the low rate did
   not provide adequate weed control even over areas of low weed cover.
   Also, the medium and high rates performed equally well over areas of
   high weed cover, indicating that the high rate exceeded the minimum
   dose required for adequate weed control. Adjustment of the rate
   scenario is necessary for optimum performance of VRT applications in
   future experiments. These adjustments may involve changes in the active
   ingredient application rates, the rate reduction percentages, the
   number of rates used, or the rate selection criteria. In addition, the
   results demonstrated the importance of using weed species information
   in the selection of herbicide dosages. (C) 2004 Silsoe Research

AB Field experiments were conducted in 1999 at Stoneville, MS, to
   determine the potential of multispectral imagery for late-season
   discrimination of weed-infested and weed-free soybean. Plant canopy
   composition for soybean and weeds was estimated after soybean or weed
   canopy closure. Weed canopy estimates ranged from 30 to 36% for all
   weed-infested soybean plots, and weeds present were browntop millet,
   barnyardgrass, and large crabgrass. In each experiment, data were
   collected for the green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) spectrums four
   times after canopy closure. The red and NIR bands were used to develop
   a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each plot, and all
   spectral bands and NDVI were used as classification features to
   discriminate between weed-infested and weed-free soybean. Spectral
   response for all bands and NDVI were often higher in weed-infested
   soybean than in weed-free soybean. Weed infestations were discriminated
   from weed-free soybean with at least 90% accuracy. Discriminant
   analysis models formed from one image were 78 to 90% accurate in
   discriminating weed infestations for other images obtained from the
   same and other experiments. Multispectral imagery has the potential for
   discriminating late-season weed infestations across a range of crop
   growth stages by using discriminant models developed from other imagery
   data sets.

AB This research determined the potential for wavelet-based analysis of
   hyperspectral reflectance signals for detecting the presence of early
   season pitted morningglory when intermixed with soybean and soil.
   Ground-level hyperspectral reflectance signals were collected in a
   field experiment containing plots of soybean and plots containing
   soybean intermixed with pitted morningglory in a conventional tillage
   system. The collected hyperspectral signals contained mixed
   reflectances for vegetation and background soil in each plot. Pure
   reflectance signals were also collected for pitted morningglory,
   soybean, and bare soil so that synthetically mixed reflectance curves
   could be generated, evaluated, and the mixing proportions controlled.
   Wavelet detail coefficients were used as features in linear
   discriminant analysis for automated discrimination between the soil +
   soybean and the soil + soybean + pitted morningglory classes. A total
   of 3 6 different mother wavelets were investigated to determine the
   effect of mother wavelet selection on the ability to detect the
   presence of pitted morningglory. When the growth stage was two to four
   leaves, which is still controllable with herbicide, the weed could be
   detected with at least 87% accuracy, regardless of mother wavelet
   selection. Moreover, the Daubechies 3, Daubechies 5, and Coiflet 5
   mother wavelets resulted in 100% classification accuracy. Most of the
   best wavelet coefficients, in terms of discriminating ability, were
   derived from the red-edge and the near-infrared regions of the
   spectrum. For comparison purposes, the raw spectral bands and principal
   components were evaluated as possible discriminating features. For the
   two-leaf to four-leaf weed growth stage, the two methods resulted in
   classification accuracies of 83% and 81%, respectively. The
   wavelet-based method was shown to be very promising in detecting the
   presence of early season pitted morningglory in mixed hyperspectral
   reflectances. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Geostatistical techniques were used to describe and map weed spatial
   distribution in two sunflower fields in Cabello and Monclova, southern
   Spain. Data from the study were used to design intermittent spraying
   strategies. Weed species, overall infestation severity (IS) index, and
   spatial distribution varied considerably between the two sites. Weed
   species displayed differences in spatial dependence regardless of IS.
   The IS mapping of each single weed and of the overall infestation was
   achieved by kriging, and site-specific application maps were then drawn
   based on the multi-species weed map and the estimated economic
   threshold (ET). Herbicide treatment was assumed to be needed for an
   overall IS score of 2 or 3, and the infested "area exceeding the
   economic threshold" was determined. The overall weed-infested area
   varied considerably between locations. About 99 and 38% of the total
   area was moderately infested (IS greater than or equal to 2) at
   Monclova. and Cabello, respectively. Therefore, if a given herbicide
   were applied just to the areas exceeding the ET a significant herbicide
   saving would be realized in Cabello but not in Monclova. A
   multi-species spatial analysis provides an opportunity to make
   site-specific management recommendations from a map of the distribution
   of IS of the total infestation. Furthermore, only in fields with
   hard-to-control weed species (e.g., nodding broomrape and corn caraway)
   would site-specific herbicide application maps developed from total
   weed infestations need to be complemented with targeted site-specific
   herbicide treatments to prevent further spread of these species,
   although their IS might be low.

AB The smart sprayer, a local-vision-sensor-based precision chemical
   application system, was developed and tested. The long-term objectives
   of this project were to develop new technologies to estimate weed
   density and size in real-time, realize site-specific weed control, and
   effectively reduce the amount of herbicide applied to the crop fields.
   This research integrated a real-time machine vision sensing system and
   individual nozzle controlling device with a commercial map-driven-ready
   herbicide sprayer to create an intelligent sensing and spraying system.
   The machine vision system was specially designed to work under outdoor
   variable lighting conditions. Multiple vision sensors were used to
   cover the target area. Weed infestation conditions in each control
   zones (management zone) were detected rather than trying to identify
   each individual plant in the field. To increase the delivery accuracy,
   each individual spray nozzle was controlled separately. The integrated
   system was tested to evaluate the effectiveness and performance under
   varying commercial field conditions. Using the onboard differential
   GPS, geo-referenced chemical input maps (equivalent to weed maps) were
   also recorded in real-time. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

AB The environmental effect of weed control systems has stimulated
   research into new practices for weed control, such as selective
   herbicide application methods on weed-infested crop areas. This
   research used the color co-occurrence method (CCM) texture analysis to
   determine the effects of plant maturity on the accuracy of weed species
   classification of digitized images. Two different experimental
   combinations of weed species and maturity level were examined. The weed
   species evaluated were ivyleaf morningglory, giant foxtail, large
   crabgrass, and velvetleaf with soil image sets added to each
   experiment. One study examined classification accuracies for two weed
   species at three maturity levels, and the second study examined four
   weed species at two maturity levels. For each species-maturity level
   combination, 40 digital images were collected from a manually seeded
   outdoor plant bed. Digitized images were transformed from the
   red-green-blue (RGB) color format into hue-saturation-intensity (HSI)
   format to generate CCM texture feature data. Stepwise variable
   reduction procedures were used to select texture variables with the
   greatest discriminant capacity. Then discriminant analysis was used to
   determine the classification accuracy for the two different
   experiments. When using HSI texture statistics, discriminant analysis
   correctly classified weed species within and across maturity levels
   with an accuracy above 97% for both experimental groups. These image
   processing algorithms demonstrate potential use for weed scouting, weed
   infestation mapping, and weed control applications using site-specific
   farming technology.

AB Managing weed infestations in a spatially precise manner requires
   accurate and cost-effective weed identification techniques. The goal Of
   Our research was to quantify the accuracy of continuous weed
   presence-absence maps and assess how management based on those maps may
   affect producer net returns. Each continuous sampled map covered the
   entire field and contained vector polygons labeled as either wild oat
   presence or wild oat absence. The accuracy Of the Continuous wild Oat
   maps at each sampling time was determined From georeferenced quadrats
   of wild oat densities. The accuracy of the continuous wild oat seedling
   maps ranged from 48.3 to 87.1% among the six site-years. The accuracy
   of the wild oat seedling maps improved by at least 8% when a 10-m
   buffer was included around areas mapped as wild oat presence. The
   accuracy of continuous wild oat panicle maps from the combine at
   harvest ranged from 65.8 to 90.9% among the six site-years. The
   variation in accuracy for the wild oat seedling maps among sites was
   greater than the accuracy of the panicle maps. Net returns ($ ha(1))
   for four site-years were calculated and compared for four possible weed
   management approaches on each field. A site-specific herbicide
   application to areas mapped as wild oat presence always generated
   higher net returns than a herbicide application mer the entire field
   fir four sites. A site-specific herbicide application to areas mapped
   as wild oat presence phis a surrounding 10-m buffer area only resulted
   in a higher net return in one of the 12 site-years compared with a
   site-specific herbicide application without the 10-m buffer. This site
   had the lowest (48.3%) wild oat seedling map accuracy, and uncontrolled
   wild oat seedling oat had a high-yield effect. This research indicates
   that using a continuous weed sampling method based on presence or
   absence for site-specific, herbicide application can be profitable over
   a herbicide application to the entire field, C en with the associated
   technology cost and seedling map errors.

AB The integration of technologies and principles to assess, manage, and
   evaluate spatial and temporal variability has enabled the site-specific
   application of variable rates of agrochemicals. It is referred to as
   precision management. This article concerns with the potential of
   precision management for weed control. Weeds are heterogeneously
   distributed and show different levels of spatial aggregation. A better
   understanding of weed patchiness is necessary for precision weed
   management. Studies reviewed in this article showed that significant
   reduction in the amount of herbicide can be achieved when the spatial
   variability of weeds is taken into account. It is often difficult,
   however, to obtain information on the spatial distribution of weeds
   with accuracy because it depends on monitoring techniques, scales of
   observation, and statistical methods applied. We conclude that the
   precision application of herbicides is one approach to managing weeds
   and it will be possible to achieve a drastic reduction in herbicide
   applications by using a combination of several different types of weed
   control strategies. Not only farmers with large fields but also those
   with small fields should have better access to information on spatial
   variability to make decisions for weed control.

AB The smart sprayer, a local-vision-sensor-based precision chemical
   application system, was developed and tested. The longterm objectives
   of this project were to develop new technologies to estimate weed
   density and size in real-time, to realize site-specific weed control,
   and to effectively reduce the amount of herbicide applied to major crop
   fields. This research integrated a real-time machine vision sensing
   system and individual nozzle controlling device with a commercial
   map-driven-ready herbicide sprayer to create an intelligent sensing and
   spraying system. The machine vision system was specially designed to
   work under outdoor variable lighting conditions. Multiple vision
   sensors were used to cover the target area. Instead of trying to
   identify each individual plant in the field, weed infestation
   conditions in each control zone (management zone) were detected. To
   increase the delivery accuracy, each individual spray nozzle was
   controlled separately. The integrated system was tested to evaluate the
   effectiveness and performance under varying commercial field
   conditions. Using the on-board differential GPS, gee-referenced
   chemical input maps (equivalent to weed maps) were also recorded in
   realtime. The maps generated with this system have been compared with
   other sensing and referencing systems.

AB Airborne remote-sensing has been identified worldwide as a promising
   technique for identifying and mapping weeds in crops, and potentially
   offers a solution to the current logjam in precision weed management:
   namely, the ability to generate timely and accurate weed maps. One of
   the main advantages of remote-sensing is that synoptic weed data can be
   acquired virtually instantaneously (within the field of view of the
   sensor), and a weed map generated within hours of data acquisition.
   However, because little information is available concerning the scale
   at which weeds should be managed within fields, the sensing and mapping
   technology has tended to dictate the resolution at which weeds must be
   mapped. This paper summarizes the work completed to date to investigate
   the use of airborne remote-sensing for weed mapping in crops, and
   discusses application of the technology in precision weed management
   practices. (C) 2001 Silsoe Research Institute.

AB Controlling pests only where necessary may be a method to reduce
   pesticide use? decrease costs, and prevent environmental damage. The
   spatial distribution of a pest within a field must be known for
   site-specific management to be possible. With knowledge of the
   characteristic distribution of a pest, cost-effective sampling plans
   and management units can be designed for site-specific management. In
   1997, two center pivot irrigated corn (Zea Mays L.) fields in eastern
   Colorado (175 and 130 ac.) were sampled and analyzed for weed seed bank
   and seedlings populations, triazine resistant pigweed seed bank, plant
   parasitic nematodes, white mold sclerotia, and western corn rootworm
   egg populations. Many crop and field attributes were sampled by other
   collaborating researchers. Research sampling plans were based on the
   biology of each pest, and time and cost constraints. Three research
   sampling plans were used: regular, random-directed, and star grids.
   There were a total of 682 observation sites in Field 1 and 621
   observation sites in Field 2 that were used to sample pest populations.
   The size of each pest population varied between fields. Within a field
   pest populations tended to be spatially aggregated. Weed distributions
   and density varied among species. As average weed seedling or seed
   densities increased, the number of observation sites that were
   weed-free decreased. Spiral, stunt, and lesion nematode species were
   detected in both fields. The nematode species observed separately were
   spatially aggregated, but when the species were combined the spatial
   distribution was uniformly distributed. White mold sclerotia were not

AB Weed population estimates were collected from four Glycine max fields
   during the summers of 1997 and 1998. Seedling weed populations were
   sampled using a regular coordinate system on a grid either 50 by 50, 30
   by 30, or 10 by 10 m. MSU-HERB and Mississippi Herbicide Application
   Decision Support System (HADSS) (yield loss prediction and herbicide
   recommendation models for G. max) were used to determine the estimated
   net gain resulting from simulated herbicide applications at each sample
   location in each field. When necessary, the appropriate data points
   from the 10- by 10-m grid were removed to form population data sets on
   grids 20 by 20, 40 by 40, and 80 by 80 m. The objectives of this
   research were to compare estimated economic returns of site-specific
   herbicide management and broadcast herbicide management in
   nontransgenic and glyphosate-tolerant G. max and to evaluate the
   effects of various weed sampling intensities on estimated economic
   returns from site-specific herbicide applications. Site-specific
   herbicide management was the compilation of simulated herbicide
   treatments giving the highest estimated net gains at each location
   within each field. Broadcast herbicide management was the simulated
   broadcast application giving the highest estimated net gain for each
   field. Sampling costs and the unattainable site-specific application
   costs were not included in the estimated net gain calculations. In
   nontransgenic G. max production, the estimated net gain for treating
   the four fields with site-specific technology was $104.76 ha(-1) higher
   than when using the optimum broadcast herbicide. In glyphosate-tolerant
   G. max production, the average estimated net gain for site-specific
   treatment of the fields was $96.24 ha(-l) higher than for treatment
   with the best broadcast herbicide application. In nontransgenic G. max,
   the estimated net gain resulting from site-specific applications on a
   10-m grid was $77.17 ha(-1) higher than from site-specific applications
   on a 20-m grid; however, in glyphosate-tolerant G. max, this difference
   was only $19.84 ha(-l). Increased estimated net gain resulted primarily
   from the use of herbicides that maximized return for each field area
   and from the decrease of unnecessary herbicide applications because of
   below-threshold weed infestations.

AB Color co-occurrence method (CCM) texture statistics were used as input
   variables for a backpropagation (BP) neural network weed classification
   model. Thirty-three unique CCM texture statistic inputs were generated
   for 40 images per class, within a six class data set. The following six
   classes were studied: giant foxtail, large crabgrass, common
   lambsquarter, velvetleaf, ivyleaf morningglory, and clear soil surface.
   The texture data was used to build six different input variable models
   for the BP network, consisting of various combinations of hue,
   saturation, and intensity (HSI) color texture statistics. The study
   evaluated classification accuracy as a function of network topology,
   and training parameter selection. In addition, training cycle
   requirements and training repeatability were studied The BP topology
   evaluation consisted of a series of tests on symmetrical two
   hidden-layer network, a test of constant complexity topologies, and
   tapered topology networks. The best symmetrical BP network achieved a
   94.7% classification accuracy for a model consisting of II inputs, five
   nodes at each of the two hidden layers and six output nodes (11 x 5 x 5
   x 6 BP network). A tapered topology (11 x 12 x 6 x 6 BP network) out
   performed all other BP topologies with an overall accuracy of 96.7% and
   individual class accuracies of 90.0% or higher.

AB The objective of this research was to evaluate the accuracy of remote
   sensing for detecting weed infestation levels during early-season
   Glycine max production. Weed population estimates were collected from
   two G. max fields approximately 8 wk after planting during summer 1998.
   Seedling weed populations were sampled using a regular grid coordinate
   system on a 10- by 10-m grid. Two days later, multispectral digital
   images of the fields were recorded. Generally, infestations of Senna
   obtusifolia, Ipomoea lacunosa, and Solanum carolinense could be
   detected with remote sensing with at least 75% accuracy. Threshold
   populations of 10 or more S. obtusifolia or I. lacunosa plants m(-2)
   were generally classified with at least 85% accuracy. Discriminant
   analysis functions formed for detecting weed populations in one field
   were at least 73% accurate in identifying S. obtusifolia and I.
   lacunosa infestations in independently collected data from another
   field. Due to highly variable soil conditions and their effects on the
   reflectance properties of the surrounding soil and vegetation, accurate
   classification of weed-free areas was generally much lower. Current
   remote sensing technology has potential for in-season weed detection;
   however, further advancements of the technology are needed to insure
   its use in future prescription weed management systems.

AB The environmental impact of herbicide utilization has stimulated
   research into new methods of weed control, such as selective herbicide
   application on highly infested crop areas. This research utilized the
   Color Go-occurrence Method (CCM) to determine whether traditional
   statistical discriminant analysis call be used to discriminate between
   six different classes of groundcover: The weed species evaluated were
   giant foxtail, crabgrass, common lambsquarter; velvetleaf; and ivyleaf
   morningglory, along with a soil image data set. The between species
   discriminant analysis showed that the CCM texture statistics procedure
   was able to classify between five weed species and soil with an
   accuracy of 93% using hue and saturation statistics, only. A
   significant accomplishment of this work was the elimination of the
   intensity texture features from the model, which reduces computational
   requirements by one-third.

AB Consumers demand for natural quality products and concern about the
   ecological impact of agriculture is growing in all European countries.
   For the farmers to follow the evolution of the market, new procedures
   have to be introduced in agriculture to obtain satisfactory production
   levels, keeping high quality standards, without damaging the
   environment.
   Image processing techniques have been traditionally used in the
   industry, where controlling most of the environmental variables (mainly
   lighting, background and speed) uses to be easy. Although these
   techniques can be also useful in agriculture, working outdoors is much
   more complicated, mainly due to the variability of the natural objects
   and the environmental conditions. European Project AIR-CT93-1299
   (PATCHWORK) was aimed at reducing or eliminating the use of chemicals
   by automatically detecting the position and/or density of weeds using
   computer vision and applying an herbicide treatment, which could be
   chemical or mechanical. This paper describes the work carried out in
   developing image. analysis procedures for two different purposes:
   In horticultural, row crops, the aim was to develop a real-time machine
   vision system that provides the position of weeds to a moving robot
   that will apply an electric discharge to them, thus eliminating the use
   of herbicides. -
   In cereals, the objective was to create weed density maps that will
   help an especial sprayer boom, incorporating a GPS sensor, to dose the
   herbicide at 4 concentrations, corresponding to 4 infestation levels
   during operation.
   The first system is based on a Bayesian algorithm for segmenting the
   images, which requires to be previously trained by an expert, who
   selects areas of different images, trying to represent the colour
   variability of the plants, the soil and the weeds. After segmentation,
   pixels belonging to class soil are correctly classified and
   morphological operations are applied to discriminate between plants and
   weeds. The system is able to properly locate more than 90% of weeds
   with very little confusion with the crop (1 %) in lettuce cultures.
   Current processing time is under 500 ms.
   The second vision system uses a normalised difference index (green and
   red channels) to enhance the contrast of the field images. Then,
   growing techniques are applied to discriminate between vegetation and
   background. Once plant pixels are identified, weeds are distinguished
   from the crop by estimating the position of the row and employing shape
   analysis techniques. The performance of the method showed that more
   than 85% of weeds were properly detected.

AB This paper describes two different solutions for the estimation of weed
   coverage, Both measuring systems discriminate the weed from the ground
   by means of the color difference between the weed and ground and can be
   used to on-line control tractor sprayers in order to reduce weedkiller
   use, The solutions differ with respect to the sensor type: one solution
   is based on a digital camera and a computer that analyzes the images
   and determines the weed amount. while the other simpler solution makes
   use of two photo detectors and an analog processing system. The
   camera-based solution provides an uncertainty of a few percentage,
   while the photo detector-based one, though extremely cheap, has an
   uncertainty of about 5% and suffers from changes in light conditions,
   which can alter the estimations.

AB A machine-vision-system-guided precision sprayer was developed and
   tested. The long-term objectives of this project were to develop new
   technologies to estimate weed density and size in real time, realize
   site-specific weed control, and effectively reduce herbicide
   application amounts for corn and soybean fields. This research
   integrated a real-time machine-vision sensing system with an automatic
   herbicide sprayer to create an intelligent sensing and spraying system.
   Multiple video images were used to cover the target area. To increase
   the accuracy, each individual spray nozzle was controlled separately.
   Instead of trying to identify each individual plant in the field, weed
   infestation zones (0.254 m x 0.34 m) were detected. The integrated
   system was tested to evaluate the effectiveness and performance under
   varying field conditions. With the current system design, and using
   0.5% weed coverage as the control zone threshold, herbicide savings of
   48% could be realized.

AB Spatial distribution of weeds in a crop is patchy. Traditional boom
   sprayers waste herbicide by applying it to areas where weed density is
   already low. A new technology, Weed Activated Spray Process (WASP),
   uses sensors to detect the presence of weeds and control spray nozzles
   accordingly. The economic benefits of this technology to extensive crop
   farmers in Western Australia are investigated using a model based on
   the economics of information. Existing technology is likely to reduce
   profits because the weed density at which it switches off spraying is
   too high. Even if sensitivity to low densities could be improved,
   likely benefits of pre-crop usage would still be very low or negative.

AB The use of spectral information for the discrimination of crops and
   weeds is reviewed, discussing research results covering most of this
   century. This includes discussions about the modelling of reflection
   from vegetation using optical and chemical information, indicating
   various problem areas (e.g. cell size, directional reflection, chemical
   composition). Models covered are those based on both the Kubelka-Munk
   theory and descriptive methods. This leads to a selection of spectral
   ranges, indices and ratios which might give useful information for
   vegetation discrimination ranging from individual plants to whole
   fields of crops. A range of experiments covering different spectral
   regions are reviewed and the usefulness of the resulting spectral
   information is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

AB Floral surveys were carried out on a field of 28 m x 100 m on the nodes
   of a regular 2 m x 2 m grid, using a rectangular sampling area of 25 cm
   x 30 cm. In total, 765 units were sampled, each one characterized by
   the spatial co-ordinates and the number of seedlings of different weed
   species. The spatial representation of the weeds was obtained with
   kriging. Simulations were carried out for Amaranthus spp., which had
   the highest frequency and density (221 plants m(-2)), and Portulaca
   oleracea L., a species that combined a more aggregated distribution
   with a medium-high density (27 plants m(-2)). The results obtained
   clearly indicated that the usefulness of geostatistical procedures
   depends on the type of question posed by the user. If the goal is to
   estimate weed density and, consequently, crop yield loss, kriging
   appears to overburden the decision-making process, without improving
   the estimates obtained. This procedure becomes useful for obtaining
   weed infestation maps to be used for intermittent spraying
   applications. The reliability of these maps increases with the number
   of samples used for kriging. With the more aggregated species, at least
   50 samples are required to obtain an infestation map. The reduction in
   the area to be treated depends on the threshold level adopted and on
   the number of samples used for kriging. With a threshold around the
   break-even point for most post-emergence treatments, this reduction
   varies from 10% to 40% with maps obtained from 50 and 175 samples
   respectively. The usefulness of infestation maps obtained with kriging
   for improving the decision-making process is strictly dependent on the
   weed patch dynamics: if these patches remain relatively stable over
   time, kriging can be carried out periodically without overburdening the
   decision-making process, whereas, if they are not stable, maps need to
   be drawn up each year, with a significant increase in costs.

AB The occurrence of Cirsium arvense L. within a sugarbeet field sire was
   completely recorded using intensity classes. By fourier analysis as a
   tool for characterizing large scale variability, we detected a periodic
   spatial structure. Small scale variability was characterized by
   variograms providing information about the spatial autocorrelation
   structure. Using the information of the results of these procedures,
   monitoring plans were suggested. Based on the data at reduced sampling
   points, we performed a reestimation of the original data set by Kriging
   and evaluated the correspondence. As data base for the various
   procedures, we used intensity classes as well as class centers. The
   results were compared.

AB Field experiments were conducted in two winter wheat fields to assess
   weed control and quantify the amount of herbicide applied with a GIS
   map-based patch sprayer. Site specific weed management decisions were
   based on previously acquired weed distribution maps and an economic
   weed threshold model. A weed treatment map (on-off) was generated and
   georeferenced to control the sprayer. A global positioning system was
   used to locate the sprayer in the field. In both fields, Alopecurus
   myosuroides was observed at low infestation levels, Galium aparine at
   medium infestation levels and the mean density for other broadleaf
   species exceeded 40 weed seedlings m(-2) in both fields. Herbicide
   application was recommended for 58.3% of the first held and 54.6% of
   the second field. With the patch sprayer used for this study, 21% less
   herbicides were sprayed compared to an uniform broadcast application.
   Additional assessments of weed density in the first field 3 and 6 weeks
   after site specific weed control showed that almost the entire field
   was weed free. The results of this study demonstrated that site
   specific weed control was technically feasible but further
   investigations are needed to verify and evaluate site specific weed
   control methods.

DE fertilizer application; precision agriculture; geo-statistics
AB Work quality, capacity and reliability are important criteria for
   design and evaluation of farm equipment. With the introduction of
   precision agriculture, the ability to adapt to spatially variable soil
   and crop conditions, becomes an additional aspect. A calculation method
   is developed to find the precision of site specific fertilizer
   application. The variance between the required rate, RR, and the
   applied rate, AR, is used as a measure for precision. The theory of
   gee-statistics is used for variance calculation. Spreading patterns are
   evaluated for different levers of field variability, positioning
   accuracy and resolution of the required application rates. The shape of
   spreading patterns had small influence. The effect of the accuracy of
   positioning systems depends on the resolution of the required
   application rates and of the working width of independently controlled
   sections of the spreaders. The study shows how machine design depends
   on the resolution of field information.

DE crop protection; integrated pest management (IPM); synthetic
   pesticides; biological control; biotechnology; sustainable agriculture
AB As a new millennium approaches, crop protectionists might profitably
   reflect on the chemical era of the 20th century, and assess their
   future contribution to world food and fibre production. New synthetic
   pesticides are increasingly selective in action and continue to be a
   cost-effective and reliable resource to many growers when properly
   managed. Risks to users and the environment from some older products
   must be reduced further through statutory and voluntary means.
   Biotechnology will play an important role in pest control but
   genetically-modified crops are not a panacea for major problems.
   Various non-chemical approaches need to become more available and
   affordable through appropriate commercialisation and government policy
   directives, with priority given to those that are compatible with
   ecology-based IPM. Information technology will also have a major impact
   on pest management and the implementation of truly integrated crop
   production. Participative farmer training is recognised as a key
   requirement for change. There is an unhealthy polarisation of views
   between some protagonists on the chemical and biological approaches to
   crop protection, particularly in tropical regions. This has to be
   resolved by better cooperation and foresight across public and private
   sectors if sustainable farming is to be realised through a balanced
   'basket of conventional and novel opportunities'. The extreme view of
   'zero pesticide' IPM must be placed in the context of growers'
   different socio-economic needs, the demands of various customers and
   scientific evidence of the real risks from modern chemical use. (C)

ID TEXTURE
AB This paper is divided into two parts. First, a new set of parameter
   relationships are presented, leading to a relatively reliable and
   simple method of calculating the shape fractal dimension (d(k))
   associated with self-similar fractal images. The method is based on
   fast Fourier transforms of video images. The normalised Fourier
   amplitude moduli (mu) are manipulated to produce two measurable power
   indices, Delta, and sigma. We then show that
   d(k) = sigma Delta
   A characteristic amplitude (mu(0)) is also defined.
   Secondly, preliminary experimental evidence supporting the validity of
   the analysis is presented, using images from cultivated canopies of 10
   different plant species, all of which are assumed to provide
   self-similar images. In addition, in anticipation of a dependence of
   numerical values of sigma, Delta, d(k) or mu(o) on species, a study of
   the discrimination potential between plant and weed species is also
   presented. Mean values and scatter associated with averaging over 10
   sample images indicate distinction between species is possible, but
   further work to test the stability of numerical values and scatter
   bands is proposed. (C) 1997 Silsoe Research Institute.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Identification of plants against a soil background using colour images
   is discussed, and a technique is presented for finding plant segments
   consisting of crop or weed plants, or both. The problems of overlapping
   plants and image border effects are explored using techniques developed
   in stereology. An automatic weed density estimation method is proposed,
   based on a non-linear regression model and features of the plant
   segments in an image. The method is applied to a set of images from
   five barley fields. At present two features of the segments are used:
   segment area and whether a segment cuts the image border or not.
   Further, a method is suggested for evaluating the automatic weed
   density estimation by comparison with an interactive weed density
   estimator including human judgement. Critical factors and ways of
   improving the automatic method by including additional features are
   discussed.

ID FIELDS
AB Intensive surveys were conducted in 2 fields in eastern Nebraska to
   determine the spatial stability of common sunflower, velvetleaf, green
   and yellow foxtail, and hemp dogbane over 4 yr (1992 to 1995). The 1st
   field was planted to soybean in 1992 and corn in 1993, 1994, and 1995.
   The 2nd field was planted to corn in 1992 and 1994 and soybean in 1993
   and 1995. Weed density was sampled prior to post-emergence herbicide
   application at approximately 800 locations per year in each field on a
   regular 7 m grid. The same locations were sampled every year. Weed
   density at locations between the sample sires was determined by linear
   triangulation interpolation. Weed seedling distribution was
   significantly aggregated, with large weed-free areas in both fields.
   Common sunflower, velvetleaf, and hemp dogbane patches were very
   persistent in diameter in the east-west and north-south directions and
   in location and area over 4 yr in the Ist field. Foxtail distribution
   and density continuously increased in each of the 4 yr in the first
   field and decreased in the 2nd field. A geographic information system
   was used to overlay maps from each year for a species. This showed that
   36% of the sampled area was continuously free of common sunflower,
   62.5% was free of hemp dogbane, and 11.5% was free of velvetleaf in the
   Ist field, but only 1% was free of velvetleaf in the 2nd field. The
   persistence of broadleaf weed patches suggests that. weed seedling
   distributions mapped in one year are good predictors of future seedling
   distributions. Improved and more efficient sampling methods are needed.

ID WEED DISTRIBUTION; YIELD LOSS
AB The spatial distribution of Elymus repens L. was mapped in five cereal
   fields during the 1994 season. Weed maps were created using a
   semi-automated system mounted on a vehicle that travelled up the
   tramlines, centred on a 12-m-wide spray boom. Two operators detected
   weeds visually and recorded their presence and density by means of a
   simple push-button system that recorded data from (2x1) m(2) areas, or
   cells, across the boom section on a portable computer. The position of
   the vehicle along the tramline was monitored by integrating output from
   a wheel sensor. Eight tramlines of one field were mapped three times
   consecutively, to assess detection and navigational error. Pair-wise
   comparisons of the three runs gave approximately 85% repeatability on
   presence/absence data, 80% on zero/low- or high-density data and 85% on
   low/high-density data when weeds were definitely present. Simultaneous
   comparisons of all three runs gave 78%, 69% and 75% respectively.
   Repeated runs of tramlines up to 550 m long recorded mean differences
   of approximately 2 m with a maximum error of 14 m (2.5%). The spatial
   distribution of E. repens within the five fields was visibly patchy,
   but the size and morphology of patches varied both within and between
   fields. Thus, the potential reduction in herbicide usage as a result of
   patch spraying varied with patch morphology and infestation level. The
   effect of lowering the resolution from six (2x1) m(2) cells to three
   (4x1) m(2) cells across the 12-m boom width showed little change in
   potential reduction in herbicide usage.

AB The authenticity of weed distribution maps prepared by the
   geostatistical estimation method, kriging, was investigated. We
   concentrated on the total number of weed plants and the dominant weed
   genus Veronica spp. in a 2.1-ha field of winter wheat. Different
   sampling distances were evaluated. Our analyses showed that kriging
   weed densities based on seedling counts collected in 0.25-m(2) circles
   in a sampling grid of approximately 10 mx10 m gave good agreement with
   actual observations. Reducing the sampling grid to 20 mx30 m gave poor
   agreement. New sampling methods combined with positioning devices and
   injection sprayers are discussed with reference to site-specific weed
   management.

AB Field experiments were conducted to study the distribution of weeds in
   18 sugarbeet fields of 3 ha each. The distance between each sampling
   point was 7.5-20 m. Weed density was counted and maps were plotted for
   the distribution of Chenopodium album and Solanum nigrum using linear
   interpolation. Geostatistical methods were applied to analyse the
   variance of weed density between the sampling points. A clear detection
   of weed patches was possible when the variance of weed density at a
   single sampling point 'nugget effect' was low and a high continuity
   between neighbouring grid points existed. If soil conditions or
   cultivation methods are nor homogeneous in the field (drift), no
   continuity between the sampling points was found. Geostatistical
   analysis of the weed distribution in agricultural fields provide
   helpful information for a site-specific weed management.

TI Control requirements for spatially selective herbicide sprayers
SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE

DT Article
DE spraying; herbicide; control; patch; spatially selective application
AB Current agronomic practice is to estimate the mean weed density over
   the whole field and use this information to decide whether or not to
   spray, and what herbicide dose to apply. It has been proposed that
   considerable long-term economic and environmental benefits would accrue
   if the herbicide dose were varied according to spatial variations in
   weed density and species. The increased availability and reduced cost
   of information technology and electronic control systems have made this
   concept more practical, but its implementation places a number of
   constraints on the specification of the sprayer and these are outlined
   and discussed. Several spraying technologies and sprayer modifications
   are examined in relation to the concept of spatially selective
   herbicide application and their ability to meet the required
   specifications.
   It is concluded that the requirements for 'patch' spraying in terms of
   the ability to apply different herbicide mixtures can be met by a
   variable concentration injection metering system. Key performance
   parameters for spatially variable application include the accuracy,
   speed of response and turn-down characteristics of the sprayer dose
   control system. Small bore pipes used with an injection metering system
   can give overall response times at the nozzle of less than 5.0 s.
   Variable concentration systems will however always require a larger
   turn-down ratio than systems operating with prediluted herbicide as
   they must account for the range of required recommended dose rates, in
   addition to the requirement to apply reduced doses. The use of twin
   fluid nozzles, pulsed nozzle systems and rotary spray generators
   operating with prediluted herbicides can achieve rapid response times
   (<1 s) and turn-down ratios greater than pressure control units. They
   may therefore have some commercial role in the design of spatially
   selective application systems. Pressure control systems alone are
   unlikely to meet the requirements of such a system.

AB The Silsoe Patch Spraying System is dependent for its operation on the
   availability of a field map of weed patch distribution. The strategy
   for building weed maps is to use a number of different techniques at
   various times through the season. Techniques may include aerial image
   interpretation, near-ground image capture and analysis and manual
   surveying. An important source of knowledge is the farmer who has a
   qualitative mental record of weed distribution in the field and who
   regularly walks his fields, thus gaining more knowledge. A compact
   hand-held data logger, based on a palm-top PC linked to a differential
   Global Positioning System (GPS) system in a backpack, has been
   developed to aid the farmer during field walking. It can record weed
   information and position, which is displayed on a screen map for later
   updating of a 'master' field weed map held on the farm PC. The software
   has been written to provide a good user interface, data checking of all
   user input and compatibility with the mapping system used to drive the
   Patch Spraying System.

AB Intensive field surveys were conducted to determine the spatial
   distribution of composite broadleaf and grass weed seedlings in seven
   maize and five soybean fields in eastern Nebraska in 1992. Farmer
   fields where herbicides were applied in a 38-cm band over 76-cm spaced
   rows were chosen for this study. Weed populations were measured in the
   interrow and in the band-treated intrarow. Spatial maps constructed for
   grass or broadleaf weeds revealed that individual species as well as
   species assemblages are highly aggregated. On average, 30% of the
   sample area in the 12 fields surveyed was free of broadleaf weeds and
   70% free of grass weeds in the interrow area (no herbicide). Where a
   pre-emergence herbicide was applied (intrarow), 71% of the sample area
   was free of broadleaf weeds and 94% free of grass weeds. Increasing the
   threshold to some value other than zero resulted in a larger field area
   not requiring a herbicide application. The results of these
   distribution studies indicate that herbicide use could be substantially
   reduced if weed distribution maps or real-time plant sensing were
   available to provide information for intermittent herbicide application
   systems or refinement of economic thresholds.

AB Shape feature analyses were performed on binary images originally
   obtained from color images of 10 common weeds, along with corn and
   soybeans, found in the Midwest. Features studied were roundness,
   aspect, perimeter/thickness, elongatedness, and seven invariant central
   moments (ICM), for each plant type and age up to 45 days after
   emergence. Shape features were generally independent of plant size,
   image rotation, and plant location within most images. The ability to
   discriminate between monocots and dicots was most evident between 14
   and 23 days using these features. Shape features that best
   distinguished these plants were aspect and first invariant central
   moment (ICM(1)), which classified 60 to 90% of the dicots from the
   monocots. Using Analysis of Variance and Tukey's multiple comparison
   tests, shape features did not change significantly for most species
   over the study period. This information could be very useful in the
   future design of advanced spot spraying applications.

AB In arable fields, most weed species are not evenly distributed, but
   grow in patches.  The breakthrough of new technologies and demands for
   a reduced herbicide usage to benefit the environment and farm economy
   have given impetus to research and development of patch spraying
   systems.  In this paper, the system elements are identified and,
   furthermore, the first Danish studies of weed spatial distribution and
   the feasibility of using a simple sensor technique for weed detection
   are reported.

ID WEED
AB An experimental agricultural spraying machine for investigating the
   effects of applying spatially variable herbicide doses is described.
   Design features of the machine which affect spatial resolution and
   steady-state accuracy of herbicide dose are examined. Experiments have
   shown that the steady-state dose can be controlled to within +/-5% of
   the set value over the system range. When using the injection metering
   systems to control dose, the sprayer will typically travel 11m before
   the effect of a change in set dose rate is seen at the nozzles. Using
   solenoid valves, four levels of dose rate can be applied within 0 . 5 m
   of a command. The finite lime taken for injection metering systems to
   respond to changes in water flow rate as sections of the boom are
   switched on and off, can cause dynamic errors in applied dose.

TI TECHNIQUES TO ESTIMATE RELATIVE LEAF-AREA AND COVER OF WEEDS IN CROPS
   FOR YIELD LOSS PREDICTION
SO WEED RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPETITION; MODEL; RED
AB Destructive measurements to collect input data for models that predict
   yield loss from relative leaf area of weeds can be laborious.
   Alternative methods were tested in seven field experiments with sugar
   beet or spring wheat. Weeds with different morphologies showed the same
   linear relationships between relative leaf area, measured
   destructively, and cover, assessed by means of a frame, until 3 or 4
   weeks after crop emergence. At later growth stages, differences in weed
   morphology resulted in different relationships. Visual estimates of
   weed cover corresponded only roughly with cover assessments with a
   frame. The possibility of estimating relative leaf area of weeds with a
   reflectance technique was tested, assuming that for early growth stages
   the leaf area index of weeds can be considered as additional to that of
   the crop. In spring wheat. relative leaf areas of Sinapis alba L., sown
   at different times and densities, correlated well with characteristics
   based on infra-red reflectance. In sugar beet, these relationships were
   not as distinct.

DE WEED IDENTIFICATION; DIGITAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
AB Plant species discrimination in mixed plant communities has recently
   become possible using transforms and shape parameters to classify
   digital images. In the present study image analysis techniques were
   used to identify weeds commonly found in winter cereal fields. Those
   species included Veronica hederifolia L., Thlaspi arvense Beauv.,
   Alopecurus myosuroides L., Apera spica-venti L., Poa annua L.,
   Stellaria media L., Capsella bursa-pastoris L., Lamium purpureum L.,
   Matricaria chamomilla L. and Galium aparine L. Images of several growth
   stages of these weeds were photographed using a Still Videokamera,
   binarified, the shape extracted and then Fourier descriptors and shape
   parameter were calculated for each weed. Classified digital images of
   each species were stored on the computer. A separate set of
   photographic images of these 10 weeds were used to test the ability of
   the classified images for plant identification.
   The average rate of correct identification was 81.9 % ranging from 41.6
   % to 100
