AB Volunteer potato is an increasing problem in crop rotations where
   winter temperatures are often not cold enough to kill tubers leftover
   from harvest. Poor control, as a result of high labor demands, causes
   diseases like Phytophthora infestans to spread to neighboring fields.
   Therefore, automatic detection and removal of volunteer plants is
   required. In this research, an adaptive Bayesian classification method
   has been developed for classification of volunteer potato plants within
   a sugar beet crop. With use of ground truth images, the classification
   accuracy of the plants was determined. In the non-adaptive scheme, the
   classification accuracy was 84.6 and 34.9% for the constant and
   changing natural light conditions, respectively. In the adaptive
   scheme, the classification accuracy increased to 89.8 and 67.7% for the
   constant and changing natural light conditions, respectively. Crop row
   information was successfully used to train the adaptive classifier,
   without having to choose training data in advance.

AB The objectives of this study were to determine the reflectance
   properties of volunteer potato and sugar beet and to assess the
   potential of separating sugar beet and volunteer potato at different
   fields and in different years. using spectral reflectance
   characteristics With the ImspectorMobile, vegetation reflection spectra
   were successfully repeatedly gathered in two fields, on seven days in 2
   years that resulted in 11 datasets. Both in the visible and in the
   near-infrared reflection region, combinations of wavelengths were
   responsible for discrimination between sugar beet and volunteer potato
   plants Two feature selection methods, discriminant analysis (DA) and
   neural network (NN), succeeded in selecting sets of discriminative
   wavebands, both for the range of 450-900 and 900-1650 nm. First, 10
   optimal wavebands were selected for each of the 11 available datasets
   individually. Second, by calculating the discriminative power of each
   selected waveband, 10 fixed wavebands were selected for all 11 datasets
   analyses Third, 3 fixed wavebands were determined for all 11 datasets.
   These three wavebands were chosen because these had been selected by
   both DA and NN and were for sensor 1 450, 765, and 855 nm and for
   sensor 2 900. 1440, and 1530 nm. With the resulting three sets of
   wavebands, classifications were performed with a DA, a neural network
   with 1 hidden neuron (NN1) and a neural network with two hidden neurons
   (NN2). The maximum classification performance was obtained with the
   near-infrared sensor coupled to the NN2 method with an optimal adapted
   set of 10 wavebands, where the percentages were 100 +/- 0.1 and 1 +/-
   1.3% for true negative (TN) classified volunteer potato plants and
   false negative (FN) classified sugar beet plants respectively. In
   general the NN2 method gave the best classification results, followed
   by DA and finally the NN1 method When the optimal adapted waveband sets
   were generalized to a set of 10 fixed wavebands, the classification
   results were still at a reasonable level of a performance at 87% TN and
   1% FN for the NN2 classification method However, when a further
   reduction and generalization was made to 3 fixed wavebands, the
   classification results were poor with a minimum performance of 69% TN
   and 3% FN for the NN2 classification method So. these results indicate
   that for the best classification results it is required that the sensor
   and classification system adapt to the specific field situation. to
   optimally discriminate between volunteer potato and sugar beet pixel
   spectra. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the previous article [Ammann, K. (2008) Feature: integrated farming:
   why organic farmers should use transgenic crops. New Biotechnol. 25,
   101-107], in a plea for the introduction of transgenic crops into
   organic and integrated farming, it was announced that the complementary
   topic, namely that high tech farmers should integrate elements of
   organic agriculture, will be a follow up. Some selected arguments for
   such a view are summarised here. Basically, they comprise a
   differentiated view on agro-biodiversity outside the field of
   production; landscape management methods to enhance biodiversity
   levels. Both elements are compatible with basic ideas of organic
   farming. First, Precision Farming is given as one example of the many
   ways to support agricultural production through high technology, with
   the aim of reducing energy input, maintaining excellent soil conditions
   and enhancing yield. It is clear from this analysis that modern
   agriculture and certain elements of organic-integrated agriculture are
   compatible. There are sectors of high tech farming, such as the
   introduction of a better recycling scheme and also a better focus on
   socio-economic aspects, which need to be taken up seriously from
   organic-integrated farming, a system which puts a lot of emphasis on
   those elements and for which important research data are available. In
   the final part a new concept of dynamic sustainability is presented.

AB Site-specific variable pesticide application is one of the major
   precision crop production management operations. Rice blast is a severe
   threat for rice production. Traditional chemistry methods can do the
   accurate crop disease identification, however they are time-consuming,
   require being executed by professionals and are of high cost. Crop
   disease identification and classification by human sight need special
   crop protection knowledge, and is low efficient. To obtain fast,
   reliable, accurate rice blast disease information is essential for
   achieving effective site-specific pesticide applications and crop
   management. The present paper describes a multi-spectral leaf blast
   identification and classification image sensor, which uses three
   channels of crop leaf and canopy images. The objective of this work was
   to develop and evaluate an algorithm under simplified lighting
   conditions for identifying damaged rice plants by the leaf blast using
   digital color images. Based on the results obtained from this study,
   the seed blast identification accuracy can be achieved at 95%, and the
   leaf blast identification accuracy can be achieved at 90% during the
   rice growing season. Thus it can be concluded that multi-spectral
   camera can provide sufficient information to perform reasonable rice
   leaf blast estimation.

AB Variable rate pesticide application holds Great potential in precision
   agriculture where application efficiency depends mainly on plant
   recognition. The segmentation of the plant from the background is key
   to plant recognition. The work presented in this paper is a real-time
   segmentation algorithm that was developed to improve the quality of
   plant segmentation under natural outdoor light conditions. The plant
   images were greyed with the colour features H, a*, I3 and Cr
   respectively, and the plant was segmented from the grey images with a
   threshold that was computed by an iterative method. Experiments showed
   that segmentation was generally of good quality if the background was
   bare soil. The quality of segmentation declines if the images are
   greyed by H and Cr, and the quality remains stable if they are greyed
   by a* and I3 when the background is complicated, and, especially with
   heavy shadows. With respect to segmentation speed, that greyed by Cr
   was the fastest and that greyed by a* was slowest amongst the four.

   specific weed recognition system based on Sample Variance of an image
   that is used for the weed classification and comparison of its result
   with the algorithm based on Population Variance. The Population
   variance has been used before for weed classification. The Processing
   time for calculating Population Variance and Sample Variance for
   different samples is given. This algorithm is specifically developed to
   classify images into broad and narrow class for real-time selective
   herbicide application. The developed system has been tested on the
   weeds in the lab along with the prior algorithm based on Population
   variance, which have shown that the system is very effective in weed
   identification and efficient than the algorithm based on Population
   variance. Further the results show a very reliable performance on
   images of weeds taken under varying field conditions. The analysis of
   the results shows over 97 percent classification accuracy over 140
   sample images (broad and narrow) with 70 samples from each category of
   weeds. The algorithm developed in this paper has improved efficiency.

AB Autonomous robotic weed control systems hold promise toward the
   automation of one of agriculture's few remaining unmechanized and
   drudging tasks, hand weed control. Robotic technology may also provide
   a means of reducing agriculture's current dependency on herbicides,
   improving its sustainability and reducing its environmental impact.
   This review describes the current status of the four core technologies
   (guidance, detection and identification, precision in-row weed control,
   and mapping) required for the successful development of a
   general-purpose robotic system for weed control. Of the four, detection
   and identification of weeds under the wide range of conditions common
   to agricultural fields remains the greatest challenge. A few complete
   robotic weed control systems have demonstrated the potential of the
   technology in the field. Additional research and development is needed
   to fully realize this potential. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The environmental impact of herbicide utilization has stimulated
   research into new methods of weed control, such as selective herbicide
   application on highly infested crop areas. This paper deals with the
   development of an algorithm which calculates angular cross sectional
   intensity of an image that is used for the weed classification. This
   algorithm is specifically developed to classify images into broad and
   narrow class for real-time selective herbicide application. The
   developed system has been tested on weeds in the lab, which have shown
   that the system to be very effective in weed identification especially
   to reduce the air and light effects of natural open air environments.
   Further the results show a very reliable performance on images of weeds
   taken under varying field conditions. The analysis of the results shows
   over 97% classification accuracy over 140 sample images (broad and
   narrow) with 70 samples from each category of weeds.

AB A machine vision system to detect and discriminate crop and weed plants
   in a commercial agricultural environment was developed and tested.
   Images are acquired in agricultural fields under natural illumination
   were studied extensively, and a weed classifier based on Radon
   Transform is developed. This classifier is specifically developed to
   classify images into broad (having broad leaves) and narrow (having
   narrow leaves) classes for real-time selective herbicide application.
   The developed system has been tested on weeds in the lab; the results
   shows reliable performance and significantly less computational efforts
   on images of weeds taken under varying field conditions. The analysis
   of the results shows over 93.5% classification accuracy over a database
   of 200 sample images with 100 samples from each category of weeds.

AB Elliptic Fourier (EF) and discriminant analyses were used to identify
   young soybean (Glycine incur (L.) merrill), sunflower (Helianthus
   pumilus), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) and velvetleaf
   (Abutilon theophrasti Medicus) plants, based on leaf shape. Chain
   encoded, Elliptic Fourier harmonic functions were generated based on
   leaf boundary. A complexity index of the leaf shape was computed using
   the variation between consecutive EF functions. Principle component
   analysis was used to select the Fourier coefficients with the best
   discriminatory power. Canonical discriminant analysis was used to
   develop species identification models based on leaf shapes extracted
   from plant color images during the second and third weeks after
   germination. The classification results showed that plant species
   during the third week were successfully identified with an average of
   correct classification rate of 89.4%. The discriminant model correctly
   classified on average: 77.9% of redroot pi.-weed, 93.8% of sunflower,
   89.4% of velvetleaf and 96.5% of soybean. Using all of the leaves
   extracted from the second and the third weeks, the overall
   classification accuracy was 89.2%. The discriminant model correctly
   classified 76.4% of redroot pi-weed, 93.6% of sunflower. 81.6% of
   velvetleaf, 91.5% of soybean leaf extracted from trifoliolate and 90.9%
   of soybean unifoliolate leaves. The Elliptic Fourier shape feature
   analysis could be an important and accurate tool for weed species
   identification and mapping, (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   presents the main principles used to realize the recognition system.
   The major principles presented in this paper are the mathematical
   description methods for rose features such as shape, size and color of
   the flower, petal, leaf, etc, and the object-oriented pattern
   recognition (OOPR) approach which mathematically deals with how to
   comprehensively use all different rose features rationally in the
   recognition scheme. The recognition system is described and some of its
   experimental results are given which demonstrate the efficiency of our

AB Automated detection and identification of weeds in crop fields is the
   greatest obstacle to development of practical site-specific weed
   management systems. Research progress is summarized for two different
   approaches to the problem, remote sensing weed mapping and ground-based
   detection using digital cameras or nonimaging sensors. The general
   spectral and spatial limitations reported for each type of weed
   identification system are reviewed. Airborne remote sensing has been
   successful for detection of distinct weed patches when the patches are
   dense and uniform and have unique spectral characteristics.
   Identification of weeds is hampered by spectral mixing in the
   relatively large pixels (typically larger than 1 by 1 m) and will not
   be possible from imagery where weed seedlings are sparsely distributed
   among crop plants. The use of multispectral imaging sensors such as
   color digital cameras on a ground-based mobile platform shows more
   promise for weed identification in field crops. Spectral features plus
   spatial features such as leaf shape and texture and plant organization
   may be extracted from these images. However, there is a need for
   research in areas such as artificial lighting, spectral band
   requirements, image processing, multiple spatial resolution systems,
   and multiperspective images.

AB Precision weed management technology has immense potential for treating
   weed species at a small scale. To this end, however, crop and weeds
   must be recognized. One approach to this involves identification of
   reflectance signatures of crops and weeds that differ in the visible
   and near-infrared (NIR) wavelength region. Reflectance spectra were
   used for the detection of cheat (Bromus secalinus L.), ryegrass (Lolium
   multiflorum Lam.), and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under
   greenhouse conditions. A total of three experiments (two in December
   2002 and one in February 2003) were conducted at the Agronomy Research
   Station, Stillwater, OK. The three species and two N levels were
   arranged in a completely randomized design with three replications.
   Spectral readings were taken at Feekes 3 and 5 winter wheat growth
   stages with a spectrometer. Two spectral measurements were obtained
   from each pot. The spectral measurements from the three experiments
   were combined by the two growth stages because preliminary analysis
   revealed that date of measurement and N levels were not significant.
   The spectral readings were measured at 1-nm intervals and averaged into
   10-mn bandwidths for the wavelengths from 400 to 865 mn. Data were
   analyzed using a discriminant analysis procedure. The discriminant
   function with the band combinations 515/675, 555/675, and 805/815
   resulted in the best overall correct classification (94%) of
   observations at Feekes 3, while for spectral data at Feekes 5 the
   discriminant function with the band combinations 755 and 855/675
   resulted in 66.7% overall correct classification of observations. In
   several instances, ryegrass was classified as either cheat or winter
   wheat, while cheat was classified as rye. Cheat was not classified as
   winter wheat in most instances. This suggests that it is possible to
   identify cheat in winter wheat using wavelength ratios developed from
   spectral readings in 10-nm bands between 500 and 860 mn.

AB In this paper an approach for automatic weed detection based on image
   analysis is presented. The system consists of three bispectral
   CCD-cameras mounted on a boom in front of a vehicle. Geocoded images
   were taken on the go automatically and stored on a computers hard disk.
   Afterwards the images were preprocessed and reduced to the outer
   contours of the objects within an image. Weeds and crop species were
   identified using shape analysis and pattern recognition. The actual
   weed identification was based on a comparison of multi invariant
   parameters, which were stored in a knowledge base. The average time for
   image acquisition and weed recognition for a set of three images was
   around 2 s. The results were documented in a file that was used for
   weed mapping. The average identification rate with a knowledge base
   based on 5 weed classes concerning to their sensitivity against
   herbicides was around 80%.

AB The objective of this research was to assess the accuracy of remote
   sensing for detecting weed species in soybean based on two primary
   criteria: the presence or absence of weeds and the identification of
   individual weed species. Treatments included weeds (giant foxtail and
   velvetleaf) grown in monoculture or interseeded with soybean, bare
   ground, and weed-free soybean. Aerial multispectral digital images were
   collected at or near soybean canopy closure from two field sites in
   2001. Weedy pixels (1.3 m(2)) were separated from weed-free soybean and
   bare ground with no more than 11% error, depending on the site.
   However, the classification of weed species varied between sites. At
   one site, velvetleaf and giant foxtail were classified with no more
   than 17% error, when monoculture and interseeded plots were combined.
   However, classification errors were as high as 39% for velvetleaf and
   17% for giant foxtail at the other site. Our results support the idea
   that remote sensing has potential for weed detection in soybean,
   particularly when weed management systems do not require
   differentiation among weed species. Additional research is needed to
   characterize the effect of weed density or cover and crop-weed
   phenology on classification accuracies.

AB A texture-based weed classification method was developed. The method
   consisted of a low-level Gabor wavelets-based feature extraction
   algorithm and a high-level neural network-based pattern recognition
   algorithm. This classification method was specifically developed to
   explore the feasibility of classifying weed images into broadleaf and
   grass categories for spatially selective weed control. In this
   research, three species of broadleaf weeds (common cocklebur,
   velvetleaf, and ivyleaf morning glory) and two grasses (giantfoxtail
   and crabgrass) that are common in Illinois were studied. After
   processing 40 sample images with 20 samples from each class, the
   results showed that the method was capable of classifying all the
   samples correctly with high computational efficiency, demonstrating its
   potential for practical implementation under real-time constraints.

AB Huanghua pear is an important fruit in China. The shape and condition
   of the stems are important indices for classifying Huanghua pears.
   Images of Huanghua pears were acquired with a machine vision system.
   Using templates with different sizes, an algorithm for judging the
   presence of stems was developed: Meanwhile; the stem head and the joint
   point between the stem and the pear body were labeled. After
   calculating slopes of the approximate tangential lines of the stein at
   the head and bottom positions, the included angle of these two lines
   was obtained. It was found that the included angle of a broken stem was
   smaller than that of a good stem. Based on this feature, good stems can
   be distinguished from broken stems. Results of a test on 53 pear images
   showed that the accuracy for judging the presence and integrity of the
   stems reached 100% and 93%, respectively. A method for describing the
   irregular. shapes of Huanghua pears was also studied. Fourier
   transformation and Fourier inverse transformation pairs were used as he
   shape descriptors.. The first 16 harmonic components of the Fourier
   descriptor were found sufficient to represent the primary shapes of
   Huanghua pears. These _ components were used as the inputs to an.
   artificial neural network (ANN) to classify Huanghua pears. The
   classification _ accuracy reached 90%.

TI Spray boom for sensing and selectively spraying small mesquite on

SO APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE

DE precision sprayer; herbicide; Prosopis; brush control; tree sensing
ID MACHINE VISION; IDENTIFICATION
AB The program currently used for mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr. var.
   glandulosa) control on highway rights-of-way in Texas, mowing and hand
   spraying of all basal stems by ground crews, is extremely labor
   intensive and the acreage that can be treated annually is limited. The
   objective of this work was to develop a spray boom that would sense
   mesquite plants and selectively apply an effective high-volume foliar
   spray containing 0.5% clopyralid + 0.5% triclopyr to the mesquite
   plants. Sprayers were designed for a tractor and an all-terrain vehicle
   (ATV) that utilized beams of pulsed infrared light to sense mesquite
   canopies. Controllers were designed to send fixed-duration pulses of
   voltage to solenoid valves for spray release through flat-fan nozzles
   when mesquite canopies interrupted the light beams. Height of the spray
   booms was adjusted on-the-go by the operator to minimize the release of
   excessive amounts of spray by tall grass or weeds. The tractor-mounted
   sprayer performed at 1.73, 1.48, and 1.15 ha/h in field plots with an
   average of 276, 985, and 970 mesquite/ha, respectively, and within each
   test site, performance was independent of mesquite density because
   ground speed remained constant. The tractor-mounted sprayer missed 13
   to 31% of the target plants. The ATV-mounted sprayer performed at 1.72
   ha/h in field trials where mesquite densities averaged 625/ha and
   missed only 16% of the target plants. Predicted performance for the ATV
   unit in densities of 200, 500, and 1000 mesquite/ha was 2.51, 1.76, and
   1.11 ha/h. The levels of mesquite mortality achieved, 38 to 67% for the
   tractor-mounted sprayer and 44% for the ATV-mounted sprayer, were
   equivalent to those mortality levels that have been achieved by ground
   crews hand spraying the same herbicide solution to mesquite regrowth in
   highway rights-of-way. These mesquite-sensing sprayers offer a viable
   alternative to hand spraying where labor is limiting and where vast
   areas must be treated. Mesquite canopies must be about 30 cm taller
   than associated vegetation to minimize off-target deposition of
   herbicide solution.

AB For effective operation of a selective sprayer with real-time local
   weed sensing, herbicides must be delivered, accurately to weed targets
   in the field. With a machine vision-based selective spraying system,
   acquiring sequential images and switching nozzles on and off at the
   correct locations are critical. An MS Windows-based imaging system was
   interfaced with a real-time embedded selective spray controller system
   to accomplish control tasks based on distance traveled A machine
   vision-based sensing system and selective herbicide control system was
   developed and installed on a sprayer A finite state machine (FSM) model
   was employed for controller design, and general design specifications
   were developed for determining the travel distance between states. The
   spatial application accuracy of the system was measured in the field
   using artificial targets. The system operated with an overall hit
   accuracy of 91% with no statistical evidence of hit accuracy or-mean
   pattern length being dependent on vehicle speed Significant differences
   in pattern length variance and mean pattern width were detected across
   speed levels ranging from 3.2 to 14 km/h. Spray patterns tended to
   shift relative to the target at higher travel speeds.

AB An image-processing algorithm using the elliptical Hough transform was
   developed to determine position, orientation, and leaf area of seedling
   leaves from top-view images. The algorithm significantly reduced the
   computational effort and memory requirement and was capable of
   identifying partly occluded leaves. Four varieties of vegetable
   seedlings, namely cabbage, Chinese mustard, edible amaranth (A.
   mangostanus Linn.), and edible amaranth (A. inamoenus Willd.), at
   various growth stages were used to test the efficacy of the measurement
   algorithm. For measurements of individual leaf area, the relative
   estimation errors were 8.2 +/- 9.3%, 14.4 +/- 11.7%, 27.5 +/- 14.4%,
   and 16.0 +/- 11.0%, respectively. For measurements of total leaf area,
   the relative estimation errors were 16.0 +/- 6.4%, 17.0 +/- 9.8%, 24.9
   +/- 8.1%, and 18.4 +/- 9.4% in corresponding order The sources of error
   were mainly due to tilting leaves and unsuccessful identification of
   small or severely occluded leaves of the seedling.

AB Different transformations of RGB colour space (discriminant analysis,
   canonical transformation, i1i2i3, HSI, HSV and Lab) were compared to
   find the best method for separating plants and background in colour
   images taken by a digital photo camera. Logarithmic discriminant
   analysis, with misclassification of plant and background pixels of
   about 2%, proved to be the most suitable transformation. However, for
   real-time working it will be necessary to develop a sufficiently
   powerful computer system. In the meantime, the i1i2i3 colour space or
   the optimised colour space (i1i2i3(new)) can be used in combination
   with an automatic binarisation system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The integration of technologies and principles to assess, manage, and
   evaluate spatial and temporal variability has enabled the site-specific
   application of variable rates of agrochemicals. It is referred to as
   precision management. This article concerns with the potential of
   precision management for weed control. Weeds are heterogeneously
   distributed and show different levels of spatial aggregation. A better
   understanding of weed patchiness is necessary for precision weed
   management. Studies reviewed in this article showed that significant
   reduction in the amount of herbicide can be achieved when the spatial
   variability of weeds is taken into account. It is often difficult,
   however, to obtain information on the spatial distribution of weeds
   with accuracy because it depends on monitoring techniques, scales of
   observation, and statistical methods applied. We conclude that the
   precision application of herbicides is one approach to managing weeds
   and it will be possible to achieve a drastic reduction in herbicide
   applications by using a combination of several different types of weed
   control strategies. Not only farmers with large fields but also those
   with small fields should have better access to information on spatial
   variability to make decisions for weed control.

AB An innovative method to study plant cross-sectional area changes under
   wind conditions is presented. Changes in soybean (KS3494) plant
   cross-sectional area at different wind velocities were studied using
   image-processing techniques with photographs taken in a wind tunnel.
   Three stages of greenhouse-grown soybean plants (V4, V6, and V8) and
   four wind velocities (6, 7, 8, and 9 m/s) were used. Changes in plant
   cross-sectional area were computed in comparison to plants with no wind
   applied. Plant images were processed in the KHOROS image-processing
   system, and the percentage change of plant cross-sectional area before
   and after wind application was calculated and analyzed. The results
   showed that plant cross-sectional areas decreased linearly with
   increased wind velocity over the range tested. Plants in V4 and V6
   growth stages were not significantly different in plant cross-sectional
   area changes, but they were significantly different from plants in the
   V8 growth stage.

AB The shape and the condition of stent are important features in
   classification of Huanghua pears. As the commonly used thinning and
   erosion-dilation algorithm in judging the presence of the stem is too
   slow, a new fast algorithm was put forward. Compared with other part of
   the pear, the stem is obviously thin and long, with the help of various
   sized templates, the judgment of whether the stem is present was easily
   made, meanwhile the stem head and the intersection point of stem bottom
   and pear were labeled. Furthermore, after the slopes of the tangential
   line of stem head and tangential Line of stem bottom were found, the
   included angle of these two lines was calculated. It was found that the
   included angle of the broken stem was obviously different from that of
   the good stent After the analysis of 53 pictures of pears, the accuracy
   to judge whether the stem is present is 100% and whether the stem is
   good reaches 93%. Also, the algorithm is of robustness and can be made
   invariant to translation and rotation. Meanwhile, the method to
   describe the shape of irregular fruits was studied. Fourier
   transformation and inverse Fourier transformation pair were adopted to
   describe the shape of Huanghua pears, and the algorithm for shape
   identification, which was based on artificial neural network, was
   developed. The first sixteen harmonic components of the Fourier
   descriptor were enough to represent the primary shape of pear, and the
   identification accuracy could reach 90% by applying the Fourier
   descriptor in combination with artificial neural network.

AB In order to improve weeding strategies in terms of pesticide reduction,
   spatial distribution and characterization of in-field weed populations
   are important. With recent improvements in image processing, many
   studies have focused on weed detection by vision techniques. However,
   weed identification still remains difficult because of outdoor scenic
   complexity and morphological variability of plants.
   A new method of weed leaf segmentation based on the use of deformable
   templates is proposed. This approach has the advantage of applying a
   priori knowledge to the object searched, improving the robustness of
   the segmentation stage. The principle consists of fitting a parametric
   model to the leaf outlines in the image, by minimizing an energy term
   related to internal constraints of the model and salient features of
   the image, such as the colour of the plant.
   This method showed promising results for one weed species, green
   foxtail (Setaria viridis). In particular, it was possible to
   characterize partially occluded leaves. This constitutes a first step
   towards a recognition system, based on leaf characteristics and their
   relative spatial position. (C) 2001 Silsoe Research Institute.

AB To identify weed species in digital images, a dimensionless analysis of
   leaves was tested at two locations in the Czech Republic with different
   soil and climatic conditions (Zabeice and Brevenec) in 1999 and 2000.
   Differences were determined among the following six weed species:
   Agropyron repens (AGRRE), Chenopodium album (CHEAL), Galinsoga
   parviflora (GALPA), Amaranthus retroflexus (AMARE), Malva neglecta
   (MALNE), and Convolvulus arvensis (CONAR). Discrimination was carried
   out according to the following leaf features: compactness, roundness,
   elongation, roughness and aspect (ratio of ellipse length and width at
   the equivalent area). it was possible to distinguish significantly the
   presented weed species from each other. There was the only case
   (location Zabeice in 2000) when significance of differences between the
   species GALPA and CONAR could not be assessed.

AB Many weed species have reddish stems, but stems of wheal and soybean
   are green. These color features were used in this study to establish a
   simple weed-detection method using a color machine-vision system, This
   method is more practical than texture- or shape-based methods because
   of its low sensitivity to canopy overlap, leaf orientation, camera
   focusing, and wind effect. Four types of relative color indices formed
   by RGB gray levels were designed, The most effective combinations of
   these color indices were selected using a statistical method. These
   combinations were used as the input variables for a statistical
   classifier based on discriminant analysis (DA) and two artificial
   neural-network (NN) classifiers, These classifiers were trained and
   rested using three weed species (Johnsongrass, redroot pigweed, and
   yellow foxtail) with soybean and three weed species (wild buckwheat,
   cheat, and field bindweed) with wheat. Preprocessing and postprocessing
   algorithms were developed to shorten the processing time and to reduce
   noise. The results showed that the statistical DA classifier was more
   accurate than the NN classifiers in classification accuracy, The
   least-square means of the classification rates using the DA classifiers
   for soybean and wheat were 54.9% and 62.2%, respectively The
   misclassification rates for most weed species were below 3%. Because
   the reddish colors on the stems of some weed species vary as the plants
   grow an in-field calibration procedure will be needed to make the
   classifiers more adaptive to different circumstances.

AB Airborne remote-sensing has been identified worldwide as a promising
   technique for identifying and mapping weeds in crops, and potentially
   offers a solution to the current logjam in precision weed management:
   namely, the ability to generate timely and accurate weed maps. One of
   the main advantages of remote-sensing is that synoptic weed data can be
   acquired virtually instantaneously (within the field of view of the
   sensor), and a weed map generated within hours of data acquisition.
   However, because little information is available concerning the scale
   at which weeds should be managed within fields, the sensing and mapping
   technology has tended to dictate the resolution at which weeds must be
   mapped. This paper summarizes the work completed to date to investigate
   the use of airborne remote-sensing for weed mapping in crops, and
   discusses application of the technology in precision weed management
   practices. (C) 2001 Silsoe Research Institute.

AB Development of new methods for weed control is one of the biggest
   scientific and technological challenges in the future. Sensor steered
   sprayers and prototypes of robots steered by digital video cameras have
   been developed for non-chemical weed control. In 1997, a collaboration
   project between the Danish National Railways Agency, the Danish
   Institute of Agricultural Sciences and Hardi International was
   initiated. The project aimed at developing a digital camera system
   (WeedEye) and a spot sprayer to reduce herbicide usage to locations
   with weeds. The results of the first experiments show that WeedEye
   detects small weed seedlings at a speed of 45 km h(-1). Further, the
   results show that WeedEye provides a reasonable estimate of the
   percentage leaf area m(-2) at this speed. The perspectives of using
   sensors and digital video cameras in agriculture an discussed.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Restricting the spraying of herbicides to control weeds is desirable,
   both from an economic and environmental point of view. Using an imaging
   spectrograph, hyper-spectral signatures of vegetation samples are
   gathered online. A classifier not only distinguishes soil and
   vegetation but also recognises different vegetation classes.
   As the reflectance of plants varies with plant stress, depending on the
   unknown field situation, a representative set of field samples must be
   collected for training on a specific field. Manually collecting a
   representative set of samples requires user-knowledge and time and is
   not economically feasible. Semi-supervised labelling based on k-means
   clustering, enables a system to automatically collect, label and train
   the classifier for a set of hyper-spectral data samples.
   Using this system to selectively spray on weeds only would result in
   acceptable weed hit rates of 89% or higher and significant reductions
   in herbicide use (15-67%), depending on the actual weed density in the

AB This paper presents a system for the detection of weed amongst crop
   based on the extraction of structural field information. Data is
   gathered online with a sensor built upon an imaging spectrograph
   optimized for this purpose. The optical sensor splits the light from a
   line on the ground parallel with the spray boom in its spectral
   components that an projected on a camera. One of the main advantages of
   this sensor type is the high spatial resolution (up to a few mm). The
   weed detection algorithm uses the reflectance differences between the
   red and the near-infrared bands to make the distinction between plants
   and soil. Detection of weed amongst crop is based on the detection of
   weed patches and the extraction of the crop rows. A mathematical model
   for the herbicide reduction and the hit rate is presented that shows
   the relations between the different system parameters such as the spray
   resolution and the performance of the classifier.

ID PLANT-IDENTIFICATION; REFLECTANCE
AB Two line imaging spectrometers covering the visible (VIS) and
   near-infrared (NIR) wavebands were further developed from remote areal
   application to close range application on single plants or parts of
   plants. Using artificial light, the line imaging NIR spectrometer was
   applied to record reflectance spectra in the wavelength range 660-1060
   nm from small areas (1.5 by 6 mm) on young plants and background (soil)
   for the investigation of plant species and crop-weed discrimination.
   Spectra. from sub-areas containing only pure plant surfaces of five
   different species were separated from others (soil, shadow or mixed) by
   the use of linear discriminant analyses in an extended segmentation
   process. Subsequently, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis,
   principal component analysis with soft independent modelling of class
   analogy, and partial least-squares regression with several Y-variables
   were applied in discrimination of crop and weeds on the reflectance
   characteristics.
   Of these methods, the bilinear methods, which are new within this
   research area, showed the highest classification performances of 70-80%
   on populations of four species tone crop and three weed species), and
   up to 90% when divided into two target groups (crop and weeds). (C)

AB Information on weed distribution within the field is necessary to
   implement spatially variable herbicide application. This paper deals
   with the development of near-ground image capture and processing
   techniques in order to detect broad-leaved weeds in cereal crops under
   actual field conditions. The proposed methods use colour information to
   discriminate between vegetation and background, whilst shape analysis
   techniques are applied to distinguish between crop and weeds. The
   determination of crop row position helps to reduce the number of
   objects to which shape analysis techniques are applied. The performance
   of algorithms was assessed by comparing the results with a human
   classification, providing an acceptable success rate. The study has
   shown that despite the difficulties in accurately determining the
   number of seedlings (as in visual surveys), it is feasible to use image
   processing techniques to estimate the relative leaf area of weeds (weed
   leaf area/total leaf area of crop and weeds) while moving across the
   field and use these data in a stratified manual weed survey of the
   field. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To implement spatially variable application of herbicides for weed
   control in arable crops, information on the distribution of weeds
   within the field is required. Manual surveying of weed patches is labor
   - intensive and not economic for production agriculture. As real-time
   patch spraying is still a difficult process, the overall objective of
   this research is to study the feasibility of automatically mapping
   weeds, a few days before the herbicide application.
   Taking into account that typical thresholding methods have shown some
   difficulties to cope with the complexity of cereal images, a
   segmentation method called dynamic model is proposed in this paper to
   distinguish between plants and soil. The method is derived from
   techniques known as 'embedded snakes', but in this case the model,
   represented by a binary image, evolves according to certain
   morphological transformations producing model contraction toward
   contour points in objects to be segmented (plants).
   It has been shown as the proposed technique improves segmentation
   results compared to other classical methods own to the better contour
   definition achieved. This is necessary in further steps devoted to
   shape discrimination between crop and weeds. On the other hand, the
   local characteristics of the algorithms permit a hardware
   implementation.

AB Though most herbicide is applied uniformly in agronomic fields, there
   is strong evidence that weeds are not distributed uniformly within the
   crop fields. If an effective weed detection system were developed, both
   economic and environmental benefits would result from its use for
   site-specific weed management. Past work in this area has focused
   mainly on either low spatial resolution photo-detectors or off-line
   machine vision systems. This study was undertaken to develop real-time
   machine vision weed detection technology for outdoor lighting
   conditions. The novel environmentally adaptive segmentation algorithm
   (EASA) was developed with the objective of real-time operation on an
   on-board computer-based system. The EASA used cluster analysis to group
   pixels of homogenous color regions of the image together which formed
   the basis for image segmentation. The performance of several variations
   of this algorithm was measured by comparing segmented field images
   produced by the EASA, fixed-color HSI region segmentation, and ISODATA
   clustering with hand-segmented reference images. The time cost and
   questionable accuracy of hand-segmented reference images led to
   exploration of the use of computer-segmented reference images.
   Sensitivity and background sensitivity were used as performance
   measures. Significant differences were found between the means of
   sensitivity, background sensitivity, and overall performance across
   segmentation schemes. Similar results were obtained with
   computer-segmented reference images.

AB Machine vision based on classical image processing techniques has the
   potential to be a useful tool for plant detection and identification.
   Plant identification is needed for weed detection, herbicide
   application or other efficient chemical spot spraying operations. The
   key to successful detection and identification of plants as species
   types is the segmentation of plants from background pixel regions. In
   particular, it would be beneficial to segment individual leaves from
   tops of canopies as well. The segmentation process yields an edge or
   binary image which contains shape feature information. Results indicate
   that red-green-blue (RGB) formats might provide the best segmentation
   criteria, based on models of human color perception. The binary image
   can be also used as a template to investigate textural features of the
   plant pixel region, using gray image co-occurrence matrices. Texture
   features considers leaf venation, colors, or additional canopy
   structure that might be used to identify various type of grasses or
   broadleaf plants.

   use of two photo detectors and an analog processing system. The
   camera-based solution provides an uncertainty of a few percentage,
   while the photo detector-based one, though extremely cheap, has an
   uncertainty of about 5% and suffers from changes in light conditions,
   which can alter the estimations.

AB An application of fractal dimensions as measures of leaf complexity to
   morphometric studies and automated plant identification is presented.
   Detailed algorithms for the calculation of compass dimension and
   averaged mass dimension together with a simple method of grasping the
   scale range related variability are given. An analysis of complexity of
   more than 300 leaves from 10 tree species is reported. Several
   classical biometric descriptors as well as 16 fractal dimension
   features were computed on digitized leaf silhouettes. It is
   demonstrated that properly defined fractal dimension based features may
   be used to discriminate between species with more than 90% accuracy,
   especially when used together with other measures. It seems, therefore,
   that they can be utilized in computer identification systems and for
   purely taxonomical purposes.

AB A machine-vision-system-guided precision sprayer was developed and
   tested. The long-term objectives of this project were to develop new
   technologies to estimate weed density and size in real time, realize
   site-specific weed control, and effectively reduce herbicide
   application amounts for corn and soybean fields. This research
   integrated a real-time machine-vision sensing system with an automatic
   herbicide sprayer to create an intelligent sensing and spraying system.
   Multiple video images were used to cover the target area. To increase
   the accuracy, each individual spray nozzle was controlled separately.
   Instead of trying to identify each individual plant in the field, weed
   infestation zones (0.254 m x 0.34 m) were detected. The integrated
   system was tested to evaluate the effectiveness and performance under
   varying field conditions. With the current system design, and using
   0.5% weed coverage as the control zone threshold, herbicide savings of
   48% could be realized.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB An automatic recognizing and evaluating method of double flowered stock
   seedlings was investigated as a basic research project to develop an
   automatic transplanting system. Three basic characteristics (area,
   complexity degree and saturation of the cotyledon) of the seedling
   image were measured by a color image processing system to fix the
   membership function of fuzzy sets. We have made the algorithm of the
   discrimination between double and single flowering forms in the
   seedling stage of stock based on the fuzzy evaluation theory. The
   accuracy of discrimination was 90.8%, and the availability of the
   seedling was 39.4% in stock plant 'Sourei'.

AB This paper describes a real-time implementation of an algorithm to
   segment plants, weeds, and soil in images used to control an autonomous
   crop protection vehicle. We show how the segmentation module fits in to
   the overall system and mention previous work on other modules. We then
   describe a segmentation algorithm and show how it is implemented on two
   digital signal processors (DSPs) controlled by a single transputer. We
   present timing information to show that the algorithm can provide data
   at 5 Hz, which is fast enough to control the vehicle. (C) 1998 Academic

AB Advanced computer vision and statistical methods were employed for
   identifying living plants from soil/residue background for two species
   of grasses (Shattercane, Green Foxtail) and two broadleaf species
   (Velvetleaf; Red Root Pigweed) weeds. The excess green index method was
   used as a contrast enhancement for specifically identifying plant from
   soil regions. Excess green classified plant and soil regions correctly
   over the entire three-week observation period with high accuracies (99%
   plus). Plant and soil binary images were derived from excess green
   images and provided edge boundaries. These boundaries were used with
   corresponding gray scale images to extract four classical textural
   features for plants and soil: angular second moment, inertia, entropy,
   and local homogeneity. These features were derived from the
   co-occurrence matrix. Stepwise and canonical discriminant analyses were
   used to test the classification performance of the texture and excess
   green features. Discrimination models of local homogeneity, inertia,
   and angular second moment were found to classify grass and broadleaf
   categories of plants, with classification accuracies of 93 and 85%,
   respectively. Classification accuracies of individual species only
   ranged from 30 to 77%. Soil classification accuracies were also high
   for textural feature algorithms (97%). The time required to produce
   tokensets ranged from 15 to 20 s on a UNIX computer system. Additional
   time required for the system to reach a plant/soil classification
   ranged from 5 to 20 s. This translated into an overall system response
   time of 20 to 30 s, with the preprocessing step constituting the major
   part of the system response time.

AB Methods were developed and evaluated that utilize state of the art
   weed-sensing technology in row-crop production systems. Spectral
   differences in green living plants and bare soil allowed 'real-time'
   weed detection, with intermittent spraying of herbicide only where
   weeds were present. Sensor units were mounted in 0.7-m-wide hooded
   sprayers providing sensors with an unobstructed view of the area
   between soybean rows. Single hood and commercial-size eight-row systems
   were evaluated, and savings in glyphosate spray solution applied using
   sensors ranged from 63 to 85%, compared to conventional hooded spray
   systems with continuous application. Weed control by the
   sensor-controlled spray system was equal to the conventional system.
   This technology can significantly reduce herbicide usage and decrease
   production cost without reducing weed control.

AB The use of spectral information for the discrimination of crops and
   weeds is reviewed, discussing research results covering most of this
   century. This includes discussions about the modelling of reflection
   from vegetation using optical and chemical information, indicating
   various problem areas (e.g. cell size, directional reflection, chemical
   composition). Models covered are those based on both the Kubelka-Munk
   theory and descriptive methods. This leads to a selection of spectral
   ranges, indices and ratios which might give useful information for
   vegetation discrimination ranging from individual plants to whole
   fields of crops. A range of experiments covering different spectral
   regions are reviewed and the usefulness of the resulting spectral
   information is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

AB Floral surveys were carried out on a field of 28 m x 100 m on the nodes
   of a regular 2 m x 2 m grid, using a rectangular sampling area of 25 cm
   x 30 cm. In total, 765 units were sampled, each one characterized by
   the spatial co-ordinates and the number of seedlings of different weed
   species. The spatial representation of the weeds was obtained with
   kriging. Simulations were carried out for Amaranthus spp., which had
   the highest frequency and density (221 plants m(-2)), and Portulaca
   oleracea L., a species that combined a more aggregated distribution
   with a medium-high density (27 plants m(-2)). The results obtained
   clearly indicated that the usefulness of geostatistical procedures
   depends on the type of question posed by the user. If the goal is to
   estimate weed density and, consequently, crop yield loss, kriging
   appears to overburden the decision-making process, without improving
   the estimates obtained. This procedure becomes useful for obtaining
   weed infestation maps to be used for intermittent spraying
   applications. The reliability of these maps increases with the number
   of samples used for kriging. With the more aggregated species, at least
   50 samples are required to obtain an infestation map. The reduction in
   the area to be treated depends on the threshold level adopted and on
   the number of samples used for kriging. With a threshold around the
   break-even point for most post-emergence treatments, this reduction
   varies from 10% to 40% with maps obtained from 50 and 175 samples
   respectively. The usefulness of infestation maps obtained with kriging
   for improving the decision-making process is strictly dependent on the
   weed patch dynamics: if these patches remain relatively stable over
   time, kriging can be carried out periodically without overburdening the
   decision-making process, whereas, if they are not stable, maps need to
   be drawn up each year, with a significant increase in costs.

AB A machine vision system to detect and locate tomato seedlings and weed
   planes in a commercial agricultural environment was developed and
   tested. Images acquired in agricultural outdoor tomato fields under
   natural-light-only conditions were studied extensively, and an
   environmentally adaptive image segmentation algorithm was developed to
   improve machine recognition of plants under these conditions. To
   overcome the plant leaf occlusion problem, an object partition
   algorithm was used to separate the overlapped leaves. Four
   morphological features were used in the plant leaf classification, and
   several structural features were used in a syntactic procedure to
   identify the whole tomato plant and its stem location in the field. The
   system was able to identify the majority of non-occluded target plant
   cotyledons, and to locate plant centers even when the plant was
   partially occluded. Of all the individual target crop plants, 65% to
   78% were correctly identified and less than 5% of the weeds were
   incorrectly identified as crop plants.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Identification of plants against a soil background using colour images
   is discussed, and a technique is presented for finding plant segments
   consisting of crop or weed plants, or both. The problems of overlapping
   plants and image border effects are explored using techniques developed
   in stereology. An automatic weed density estimation method is proposed,
   based on a non-linear regression model and features of the plant
   segments in an image. The method is applied to a set of images from
   five barley fields. At present two features of the segments are used:
   segment area and whether a segment cuts the image border or not.
   Further, a method is suggested for evaluating the automatic weed
   density estimation by comparison with an interactive weed density
   estimator including human judgement. Critical factors and ways of
   improving the automatic method by including additional features are
   discussed.

TI A technique for mapping the spatial distribution of Elymus repens, with
   estimates of the potential reduction in herbicide usage from patch

SO WEED RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID WEED DISTRIBUTION; YIELD LOSS
AB The spatial distribution of Elymus repens L. was mapped in five cereal
   fields during the 1994 season. Weed maps were created using a
   semi-automated system mounted on a vehicle that travelled up the
   tramlines, centred on a 12-m-wide spray boom. Two operators detected
   weeds visually and recorded their presence and density by means of a
   simple push-button system that recorded data from (2x1) m(2) areas, or
   cells, across the boom section on a portable computer. The position of
   the vehicle along the tramline was monitored by integrating output from
   a wheel sensor. Eight tramlines of one field were mapped three times
   consecutively, to assess detection and navigational error. Pair-wise
   comparisons of the three runs gave approximately 85% repeatability on
   presence/absence data, 80% on zero/low- or high-density data and 85% on
   low/high-density data when weeds were definitely present. Simultaneous
   comparisons of all three runs gave 78%, 69% and 75% respectively.
   Repeated runs of tramlines up to 550 m long recorded mean differences
   of approximately 2 m with a maximum error of 14 m (2.5%). The spatial
   distribution of E. repens within the five fields was visibly patchy,
   but the size and morphology of patches varied both within and between
   fields. Thus, the potential reduction in herbicide usage as a result of
   patch spraying varied with patch morphology and infestation level. The
   effect of lowering the resolution from six (2x1) m(2) cells to three
   (4x1) m(2) cells across the 12-m boom width showed little change in
   potential reduction in herbicide usage.

AB The authenticity of weed distribution maps prepared by the
   geostatistical estimation method, kriging, was investigated. We
   concentrated on the total number of weed plants and the dominant weed
   genus Veronica spp. in a 2.1-ha field of winter wheat. Different
   sampling distances were evaluated. Our analyses showed that kriging
   weed densities based on seedling counts collected in 0.25-m(2) circles
   in a sampling grid of approximately 10 mx10 m gave good agreement with
   actual observations. Reducing the sampling grid to 20 mx30 m gave poor
   agreement. New sampling methods combined with positioning devices and
   injection sprayers are discussed with reference to site-specific weed
   management.

ID PLANT-IDENTIFICATION; DIGITAL IMAGES; MACHINE VISION; LEAVES
AB Identification of plants is important to develop robotics for pest,
   disease, and weed control with machine vision. Leaf shape is a common
   source of information used to identify plants. Intelligent vision
   systems are the next generation in machine vision. The addition of
   intelligence into vision systems requires an understanding and
   structuring of human visual techniques.
   Image acquisition and processing software was developed and evaluated
   to identify idealized leaf types using simple dimensionless shape
   factors. Compactness, roundness, elongation, lobation, and roughness
   were defined and used as the shape factors. The shape factors require
   neither a heavier computer load nor a larger amount of computer memory.
   They are not only size and rotational independent, but also suitable
   for imitating human visual memories.
   The Makino's 50 figures which illustrated the terminologies applied to
   the lamina shapes of leaves by a diagram were selected as idealized
   leaf types. It was theoretically possible to identify 1,280 leaf types
   using the shape factors by image analysis with sufficient resolution.
   Results indicate the simple dimensionless shape factors will be useful
   to identify plants by their leaf shapes, and to compose knowledge bases
   of the intelligent vision systems.

AB The work presented is part of a project whose goal is to guide
   automatically a vehicle along crop rows to apply herbicide or pesticide
   accurately on weeds or plants. The paper deals with the segmentation of
   near-infrared images for discriminating plants, weeds, and soil. A
   restricted problem domain has been chosen, that of transplanted
   vegetable crops using cauliflower as a model. Furthermore, the natural
   lighting has been limited to diffuse illumination conditions. The
   algorithms described have been developed with a real-time
   implementation in mind. The algorithms use techniques based on global
   and multithresholding methods, gradient detection, various methods of
   noise elimination. blob filtering, and mathematical morphology. They
   can provide information on the size and the position of plants and weed
   patches as well as information that could be used either for guiding
   the vehicle or tracking plants and weeds. Successful segmentation has
   been done on several image sequences. Pt is shown that it is possible
   to discriminate plants. weeds, and soil with simple algorithms for
   different fields of view.

ID PLANT-IDENTIFICATION
AB A machine vision system was used to identify weeds commonly found in
   Kansas wheat fields, including Russian thistle, redroot pigweed, Palmer
   amaranth, wild buckwheat, and kochia. Three different approaches, color
   analysis, shape analysis, and texture analysis, were used in the study.
   For the color analysis approach, ratios of pixel gray levels in images
   taken using four selected color filters were useful in classifying
   pixels into five different categories-wheat leaf weed leaf, weed stem,
   soil, and sand. A red/green filter pair was found effective in
   identifying reddish stems of redroot pigweed, Russian thistle, and
   kochia. Five shape parameters, eccentricity, compactness, and three
   invariant moments, were used in leaf shape studies and were found
   effective in distinguishing broadleaf weed species such as redroot
   pigweed, wild buckwheat, and kochia from wheat. For the texture
   analysis approach, Fourier spectra of selected windows within leaf
   areas of wheat and weed species were analyzed. An index of fineness was
   defined using the spectra. Leaves with fine textures such as kochia can
   be distinguished from others using this index. Curves of normalized
   radial spectral energy were derived from the spectra. Leaves with
   distinct directionality features such as wheat and some broadleaf weed
   species can be distinguished using parameters defined using these
   curves. This study is the first step of a project with an overall goal
   of developing techniques of selective herbicide application based on
   weed defection.

AB Color slide images of weeds among various soils and residues were
   digitized and analyzed for red, green, and blue (RGB) color content.
   Red, green, and blue chromatic coordinates (rgb) of plants were very
   different from those of background soils and residue. To distinguish
   living plant material from a nonplant background, several indices of
   chromatic coordinates were studied, rested, and were successful in
   identifying weeds. The indices included r-g, g-b, (g-b)/\r-g\, and
   2g-r-b. A modified hue was also used to distinguish weeds from
   non-plant surfaces. The modified hue, 2g-r-b index, and the green
   chromatic coordinate distinguished weeds from a nonplant background
   (0.05 level of significance) better than other indices. However, the
   modified hue was the most computationally intense. These indices worked
   well for both nonshaded and shaded sunlit conditions. These indices
   could be used for sensor design for detecting weeds for spot spraying
   control.

AB Shape feature analyses were performed on binary images originally
   obtained from color images of 10 common weeds, along with corn and
   soybeans, found in the Midwest. Features studied were roundness,
   aspect, perimeter/thickness, elongatedness, and seven invariant central
   moments (ICM), for each plant type and age up to 45 days after
   emergence. Shape features were generally independent of plant size,
   image rotation, and plant location within most images. The ability to
   discriminate between monocots and dicots was most evident between 14
   and 23 days using these features. Shape features that best
   distinguished these plants were aspect and first invariant central
   moment (ICM(1)), which classified 60 to 90% of the dicots from the
   monocots. Using Analysis of Variance and Tukey's multiple comparison
   tests, shape features did not change significantly for most species
   over the study period. This information could be very useful in the
   future design of advanced spot spraying applications.

AB In arable fields, most weed species are not evenly distributed, but
   grow in patches.  The breakthrough of new technologies and demands for
   a reduced herbicide usage to benefit the environment and farm economy
   have given impetus to research and development of patch spraying
   systems.  In this paper, the system elements are identified and,
   furthermore, the first Danish studies of weed spatial distribution and
   the feasibility of using a simple sensor technique for weed detection
   are reported.

DE WEED IDENTIFICATION; DIGITAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
AB Plant species discrimination in mixed plant communities has recently
   become possible using transforms and shape parameters to classify
   digital images. In the present study image analysis techniques were
   used to identify weeds commonly found in winter cereal fields. Those
   species included Veronica hederifolia L., Thlaspi arvense Beauv.,
   Alopecurus myosuroides L., Apera spica-venti L., Poa annua L.,
   Stellaria media L., Capsella bursa-pastoris L., Lamium purpureum L.,
   Matricaria chamomilla L. and Galium aparine L. Images of several growth
   stages of these weeds were photographed using a Still Videokamera,
   binarified, the shape extracted and then Fourier descriptors and shape
   parameter were calculated for each weed. Classified digital images of
   each species were stored on the computer. A separate set of
   photographic images of these 10 weeds were used to test the ability of
   the classified images for plant identification.
   The average rate of correct identification was 81.9 % ranging from 41.6
   % to 100

AB An image-processing algorithm was developed that used color as well as
   geometric data to identify geranium cutting features such as petioles,
   main stem, leaf blades, and growing tip. The algorithm identified
   features independent of the orientation of the cuttings in the field of
   view. Cutting images were segmented into smaller objects which were
   classified according to geometric and 18-bit RGB color data. Correct
   pixel classification for leaf, petiole, and main stem material were 97,
   95, and 93%, respectively. Some limitations observed were slow
   execution time (3 to 12 s) due to the volume of data accessed,
   misclassification due to the statistical color pixel classifier
   inadequately modeling the color space, and shadows causing improper
   segmentation.

AB Intelligent vision systems capable of automatically interpreting images
   are the next generation in machine vision. These systems will be usable
   by nonexperts in the machine vision field, and be flexible and
   reprogrammable for general use. The addition of intelligence into
   vision systems requires an understanding and structuring of human
   visual and scene interpretation techniques.
   This research investigated the interrelationships and combined the
   areas of feature extraction, pattern recognition and techniques of
   scene interpretation by humans. The research is especially unique in
   its rule-based structuring of subjective, qualitative, human-level
   shape features and quantitative machine-level shape features. An
   algorithm was implemented to extract plant/leaf shape features using
   information gathered from critical points along object borders such as
   the location of angles along the border and/or local maxima and minima
   from the plant/leaf centroid A library or set of 17 low-level
   quantitative features and the rule-base combining the low-level
   features into 13 higher-level quantitative features, demonstrated the
   ability to combine and structure basic explicit data or information
   into more subjective shape knowledge. Structuring and verifying the
   features added intelligence to the system and illustrated a potential
   technique for bridging the shape interpretation levels of man and
   machine.
   Results indicate a structuring of knowledge levels can be used to link
   machine and human shape interpretation, especially if descriptive
   features involve minimal ambiguity, i.ev., they are basic and generic
   for the humans assigning shape certainties to the recognition knowledge
   base.

AB Knowledge engineering involves simulating the problem solving logic of
   a human expert, group of experts, or a constructed "expert process." 
   It is the integration of assimilated information as knowledge with
   data.  This is, in fact, the procedure used in human decision making. 
   The potential capabilities for knowledge engineering to help solve
   ill-structured agricultural problems where information and data are
   incomplete has excited many scientists.  However, knowledge engineering
   is in its infancy and is not ready for widespread, economically viable
   application to commercial agriculture.  The state of the art for
   developing and using agricultural knowledge-based decision support
   "expert" systems is discussed; representative examples depicting areas
   that are most promising are presented, and specific examples from the
   authors' experiences are given.  These are followed by comments on
   commercialization, pitfalls, needed developments, and prognosis.

AB Weeds are frequently distributed non-uniformly within fields. 
   Herbicide use could be reduced either by applying it only to
   weed-infested areas or by applying a low dose rate to the whole field
   and normal dose rate to weed patches.  A necessary prerequisite is an
   effective method of weed detection.  Tractor-mounted detectors do not
   appear to be feasible.  Thus real-time weed detection and sprayer
   control are not currently possible.  It is shown, however, that
   spatially variable herbicide application using a sprayer location
   system and a field map of weed location has potential.  The data map
   would be constructed from a number of weed-location techniques based on
   image analysis, such as tractor-mounted video cameras, aerial
   photographs and manual field observation.
