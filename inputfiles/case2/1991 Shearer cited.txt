AB An aerial variable-rate application system consisting of DGPS
   (Differential Global Positioning System)-based guidance, an automatic
   flow controller, and a hydraulically controlled pump was evaluated for
   response to rapidly changing flow requirements and accuracy of
   application. Spray deposition position error was evaluated by direct
   field observation of water-sensitive paper (WSP) cards while traveling
   east to west and north to south across rate change boundaries. Data
   from the flow controller and a custom-built flowmeter monitor were used
   to evaluate flow controller error and variable-rate system error while
   making applications to a series of four management zones (28, 47, 56,
   and 37 L ha(-1); each 81 in long). Observations of WSP showed that
   average spray deposition position error magnitude was 5.0 in when
   traveling east to west and 5.2 in when traveling north to south.
   Statistical analysis indicated that direction of travel had a
   non-significant effect on the magnitude of spray deposition position
   error Flow controller error and variable-rate system error were
   evaluated from data collected while making applications to a series of
   four management zones (each zone required approximately 1.2 s) with
   application rates of 28, 47, 56, and 37 L ha-1. Areas under time plots
   of required and actual flow rates were compared and indicated flow
   controller error ranging from -1.0% to 2.1%. Variable-rate system error
   due to rate change timing was evaluated by comparing required rates
   from the system to required rates from the prescription. A rea under
   time plots of these variables showed that average rate timing error for
   six application passes ranged from -9.1% to 1.4% with an average of
   -3.04%. Considering the speed at which changes have to be made for
   aircraft typically flying at 65 m s(-1), the hydraulically operated
   variable-rale system performed well for location accuracy of
   deposition, response to changing flow rates, and accuracy of
   application amounts for the prescription.

AB Conventionally, herbicides are applied uniformly in the fields, while
   there is strong evidence that weeds are not distributed uniformly
   within crop fields and they tend to occur in clumps or patches. This
   manuscript presents the development of a prototype patch sprayer for
   target oriented weed control system by integration of differential
   global positioning system (DGPS), Geographical Information System
   (GIS), and solenoid-activated spray nozzles in response to signals
   generated by a displacement sensor. A set of Ashteck Promark2 DGPS
   receivers (fixed and rover) was used to collect weed position data in
   the test plots. A micro-controller was designed, fabricated and used to
   retrieve weed patch locations on the electronic map and simultaneously
   receiving grid signals from an infra-red displacement sensor mounted on
   the sprayer front wheel to generate and send activating signals to the
   sprayer nozzle solenoids.
   A randomized complete block experiment was conducted with three
   herbicide spraying treatments consisting of targeted patch spraying,
   conventional (uniform) spraying, and nospraying (control) in three
   replications to assess the field performance. In the patch spraying
   treatment, spray mixture (Gramoxin, 10%) was sprayed only over the
   target (weed-infested) grids as controlled by a displacement sensor, an
   electronic weed map, and a microprocessor, while the conventional
   treatment plots received uniform and continuous application of the
   spray mixture. Patch spraying application was as effective as the
   conventional (uniform) application method in controlling weed
   infestation. The two spraying methods were significantly different at
   99% confidence level with mean values of herbicide consumption rates of
   40 and 12.21/ha for the conventional and patch spraying methods,
   respectively This indicates that targeted weed patch herbicide
   application resulted in 69.5% saving compared to the conventional
   application. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of south Texas is an agriculturally
   rich area supporting intensive production of vegetables, fruits, grain
   sorghum, and cotton. Modern agricultural practices involve the combined
   use of irrigation with the application of large amounts of
   agrochemicals to maximize crop yields. Intensive agricultural
   activities in past decades might have caused potential contamination of
   soil, surface water.. and groundwater due to leaching of pesticides in
   the vadose zone. In an effort to promote precision farming in citrus
   production, this paper aims at developing an airborne multispectral
   technique for identifying tree health problems in a citrus grove that
   can be combined with variable rate technology (VRT) for required
   pesticide application and environmental modeling for assessment of
   pollution prevention. An unsupervised linear unmixing method was
   applied to classify the image for the grove and quantify the symptom
   severity for appropriate infection control. The PRZM-3 model was used
   to estimate environmental impacts that contribute to nonpoint source
   pollution with and without the use of multispectral remote sensing and
   VRT. Research findings using site-specific environmental assessment
   clearly indicate that combination of remote sensing and VRT may result
   in benefit to the environment by reducing the nonpoint source pollution
   by 92.15%. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of precision
   farming for citrus production in the nexus of industrial ecology and
   agricultural sustainability. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The commercial use of agricultural remote sensing to improve farm
   management is closer to becoming a reality. Officially opened and
   dedicated in April 2001, the Illinois Laboratory for Agricultural
   Remote Sensing (ILARS) located at the University of Illinois in
   Urbana-Champaign is bringing together research experts in crop
   sciences, agricultural engineering, biotechnology, precision farming
   and information systems to develop "real world" applications of remote
   sensing. Among future research endeavors, ILARS scientists envision the
   development of high-accuracy remote sensing systems for precision
   agriculture application. This paper summarizes major current projects
   in the Illinois Laboratory for Agricultural Remote Sensing at

AB In-furrow chemical inputs such as fungicides, insecticides, and
   nematicides are generally applied at planting as a continuous band of
   material. Focusing these applications at the seed and minimizing the
   amount of chemical applied between seeds has potential to significantly
   reduce in-furrow inputs. An in-furrow seed-specific application system
   was developed to apply discrete bands of liquid chemical to individual
   seeds during planting. Each seed was detected in the seed tube, seed
   arrival time at the furrow was estimated, and a chemical band was
   applied as the seed landed in the furrow. The seed-specific applicator
   was evaluated at three field speeds and four spray band lengths during
   corn and cotton plantings. Accuracy of spray band placement, measured
   as percent of seeds observed within a sprayed band of soil, ranged from
   63% to 97% in corn and from 56% to 98% in cotton, depending on field
   speed and spray band length. As spray band length increased from 3.8 to
   7.6 cm, accuracy (averaged across speeds) increased from 76% to 91% in
   corn and from 72% to 95% in cotton. Accuracy and field speed were
   inversely related, with highest accuracies observed at the slowest
   speed. While the applicator performed well, further improvements may be
   possible, especially when operating at highfield speeds. Substantial
   in-furrow material savings are feasible and depend on desired seeding
   rates and spray band lengths.

AB Weed control effectiveness and herbicide savings were determined for a
   variable-rate technology (VRT) herbicide application scenario involving
   three rates, including 100, 67 and 33% rates. Four herbicide
   treatments, including the VRT scenario and three blanket applications,
   were tested over a plot of soya beans with a severe weed problem. In
   the comparison of VRT and conventional methods, the former achieved the
   best performance in terms of weed control effectiveness and herbicide
   use efficiency. However, the particular rate scenario used for VRT
   applications was shown to have flaws. Specifically, the low rate did
   not provide adequate weed control even over areas of low weed cover.
   Also, the medium and high rates performed equally well over areas of
   high weed cover, indicating that the high rate exceeded the minimum
   dose required for adequate weed control. Adjustment of the rate
   scenario is necessary for optimum performance of VRT applications in
   future experiments. These adjustments may involve changes in the active
   ingredient application rates, the rate reduction percentages, the
   number of rates used, or the rate selection criteria. In addition, the
   results demonstrated the importance of using weed species information
   in the selection of herbicide dosages. (C) 2004 Silsoe Research

AB This research studied and compared the applications of the remote
   sensing system with the commercial map-driven-ready sprayer, and a
   real-time machine vision guided individual nozzle controlling device in
   high-accuracy selective herbicide applications. Remote sensing data was
   used to identify weed infestation area and simulate map-driven
   selective herbicide application. The machine vision guided system was
   specially designed to work under outdoor variable lighting conditions.
   Multiple vision sensors were used to cover the target area. To increase
   the delivery accuracy, each individual spray nozzle was controlled
   separately, The integrated system was tested to evaluate the
   effectiveness and performance under varying commercial field
   conditions. Using the on-board differential GPS, geo-referenced
   chemical input maps (equivalent to weed maps) were also recorded in
   real-time. The maps generated with this system have been compared with
   other sensing and referencing remote sensing systems.

AB For effective operation of a selective sprayer with real-time local
   weed sensing, herbicides must be delivered, accurately to weed targets
   in the field. With a machine vision-based selective spraying system,
   acquiring sequential images and switching nozzles on and off at the
   correct locations are critical. An MS Windows-based imaging system was
   interfaced with a real-time embedded selective spray controller system
   to accomplish control tasks based on distance traveled A machine
   vision-based sensing system and selective herbicide control system was
   developed and installed on a sprayer A finite state machine (FSM) model
   was employed for controller design, and general design specifications
   were developed for determining the travel distance between states. The
   spatial application accuracy of the system was measured in the field
   using artificial targets. The system operated with an overall hit
   accuracy of 91% with no statistical evidence of hit accuracy or-mean
   pattern length being dependent on vehicle speed Significant differences
   in pattern length variance and mean pattern width were detected across
   speed levels ranging from 3.2 to 14 km/h. Spray patterns tended to
   shift relative to the target at higher travel speeds.

AB The smart sprayer, a local-vision-sensor-based precision chemical
   application system, was developed and tested. The long-term objectives
   of this project were to develop new technologies to estimate weed
   density and size in real-time, realize site-specific weed control, and
   effectively reduce the amount of herbicide applied to the crop fields.
   This research integrated a real-time machine vision sensing system and
   individual nozzle controlling device with a commercial map-driven-ready
   herbicide sprayer to create an intelligent sensing and spraying system.
   The machine vision system was specially designed to work under outdoor
   variable lighting conditions. Multiple vision sensors were used to
   cover the target area. Weed infestation conditions in each control
   zones (management zone) were detected rather than trying to identify
   each individual plant in the field. To increase the delivery accuracy,
   each individual spray nozzle was controlled separately. The integrated
   system was tested to evaluate the effectiveness and performance under
   varying commercial field conditions. Using the onboard differential
   GPS, geo-referenced chemical input maps (equivalent to weed maps) were
   also recorded in real-time. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

AB Many weed species have reddish stems, but stems of wheal and soybean
   are green. These color features were used in this study to establish a
   simple weed-detection method using a color machine-vision system, This
   method is more practical than texture- or shape-based methods because
   of its low sensitivity to canopy overlap, leaf orientation, camera
   focusing, and wind effect. Four types of relative color indices formed
   by RGB gray levels were designed, The most effective combinations of
   these color indices were selected using a statistical method. These
   combinations were used as the input variables for a statistical
   classifier based on discriminant analysis (DA) and two artificial
   neural-network (NN) classifiers, These classifiers were trained and
   rested using three weed species (Johnsongrass, redroot pigweed, and
   yellow foxtail) with soybean and three weed species (wild buckwheat,
   cheat, and field bindweed) with wheat. Preprocessing and postprocessing
   algorithms were developed to shorten the processing time and to reduce
   noise. The results showed that the statistical DA classifier was more
   accurate than the NN classifiers in classification accuracy, The
   least-square means of the classification rates using the DA classifiers
   for soybean and wheat were 54.9% and 62.2%, respectively The
   misclassification rates for most weed species were below 3%. Because
   the reddish colors on the stems of some weed species vary as the plants
   grow an in-field calibration procedure will be needed to make the
   classifiers more adaptive to different circumstances.

AB A system to estimate the weed density between two rows of soybeans was
   developed. An environmentally adaptive segmentation algorithm (EASA)
   was used to segment the plants from the background of the image. The
   effect of two image data transformations on the segmentation
   performance of the EASA was investigated, and the RGB-IV1V2
   transformation resulted in significantly higher quality segmentation
   results based on morphological opening and closing pixel loss over the
   RGB-rgb transformation. An adaptive scanning algorithm (ASA) was
   developed and used to automatically detect crop inter-row edges and to
   estimate the number of weeds in the inter-row area. Two sets of images
   were acquired under sunny and overcast sky conditions. The ASA-detected
   crop row edge positions were significantly correlated with the manually
   detected crop row positions, with the distribution skewed towards
   positions internal to the row. ASA weed density estimates were highly
   correlated with manual weed counts for both lighting conditions.
   However; when a limited range of the data was considered, much lower
   correlations resulted, revealing a loss of spatial color resolution due
   to the transmission of the video signal. The mean execution time of the
   ASA was 0.038 s for 0.91 m (3 ft) long inter-row regions showing that
   the algorithm met the real-time constraints necessary to be used as a
   sensing system for a variable-rate herbicide applicator.

AB Though most herbicide is applied uniformly in agronomic fields, there
   is strong evidence that weeds are not distributed uniformly within the
   crop fields. If an effective weed detection system were developed, both
   economic and environmental benefits would result from its use for
   site-specific weed management. Past work in this area has focused
   mainly on either low spatial resolution photo-detectors or off-line
   machine vision systems. This study was undertaken to develop real-time
   machine vision weed detection technology for outdoor lighting
   conditions. The novel environmentally adaptive segmentation algorithm
   (EASA) was developed with the objective of real-time operation on an
   on-board computer-based system. The EASA used cluster analysis to group
   pixels of homogenous color regions of the image together which formed
   the basis for image segmentation. The performance of several variations
   of this algorithm was measured by comparing segmented field images
   produced by the EASA, fixed-color HSI region segmentation, and ISODATA
   clustering with hand-segmented reference images. The time cost and
   questionable accuracy of hand-segmented reference images led to
   exploration of the use of computer-segmented reference images.
   Sensitivity and background sensitivity were used as performance
   measures. Significant differences were found between the means of
   sensitivity, background sensitivity, and overall performance across
   segmentation schemes. Similar results were obtained with
   computer-segmented reference images.

SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE

DT Article
DE weed; detection; sensor irradiance; reflective light
AB Data from a photoelectric diode sensor equipped with 670 and 780 nm
   interference filters, were analyzed to determine the maximum
   field-of-view and minimum percentage of soil covered by bindweed
   (Convolvulus arvensis) that could be distinguished from bare soil.
   Images containing one 150-mm bindweed could be distinguished from
   images of adjacent bare soil for all fields-of-view implying that
   adaptive thresholding would enable use of a field-of-view as large as
   0.71 m(2). Detection was 1000% for nine of the II fields-of-view
   evaluated and 98% for the other two. When bare soil images were not
   paired with adjacent bindweed images, a single NDVI threshold could be
   used to distinguish between the two images with error Results indicated
   that the required percentage of bindweed cover within art image was 12%
   for a 5% error in falsely detecting or failing to detect the presence
   of bindweed. Error for a fixed NDVI threshold decreased when classified
   by apparent soil moisture when compared with unclassified data.

AB A machine-vision-system-guided precision sprayer was developed and
   tested. The long-term objectives of this project were to develop new
   technologies to estimate weed density and size in real time, realize
   site-specific weed control, and effectively reduce herbicide
   application amounts for corn and soybean fields. This research
   integrated a real-time machine-vision sensing system with an automatic
   herbicide sprayer to create an intelligent sensing and spraying system.
   Multiple video images were used to cover the target area. To increase
   the accuracy, each individual spray nozzle was controlled separately.
   Instead of trying to identify each individual plant in the field, weed
   infestation zones (0.254 m x 0.34 m) were detected. The integrated
   system was tested to evaluate the effectiveness and performance under
   varying field conditions. With the current system design, and using
   0.5% weed coverage as the control zone threshold, herbicide savings of
   48% could be realized.

AB Methods were developed and evaluated that utilize state of the art
   weed-sensing technology in row-crop production systems. Spectral
   differences in green living plants and bare soil allowed 'real-time'
   weed detection, with intermittent spraying of herbicide only where
   weeds were present. Sensor units were mounted in 0.7-m-wide hooded
   sprayers providing sensors with an unobstructed view of the area
   between soybean rows. Single hood and commercial-size eight-row systems
   were evaluated, and savings in glyphosate spray solution applied using
   sensors ranged from 63 to 85%, compared to conventional hooded spray
   systems with continuous application. Weed control by the
   sensor-controlled spray system was equal to the conventional system.
   This technology can significantly reduce herbicide usage and decrease
   production cost without reducing weed control.

ID PLANT-IDENTIFICATION
AB A machine vision system was used to identify weeds commonly found in
   Kansas wheat fields, including Russian thistle, redroot pigweed, Palmer
   amaranth, wild buckwheat, and kochia. Three different approaches, color
   analysis, shape analysis, and texture analysis, were used in the study.
   For the color analysis approach, ratios of pixel gray levels in images
   taken using four selected color filters were useful in classifying
   pixels into five different categories-wheat leaf weed leaf, weed stem,
   soil, and sand. A red/green filter pair was found effective in
   identifying reddish stems of redroot pigweed, Russian thistle, and
   kochia. Five shape parameters, eccentricity, compactness, and three
   invariant moments, were used in leaf shape studies and were found
   effective in distinguishing broadleaf weed species such as redroot
   pigweed, wild buckwheat, and kochia from wheat. For the texture
   analysis approach, Fourier spectra of selected windows within leaf
   areas of wheat and weed species were analyzed. An index of fineness was
   defined using the spectra. Leaves with fine textures such as kochia can
   be distinguished from others using this index. Curves of normalized
   radial spectral energy were derived from the spectra. Leaves with
   distinct directionality features such as wheat and some broadleaf weed
   species can be distinguished using parameters defined using these
   curves. This study is the first step of a project with an overall goal
   of developing techniques of selective herbicide application based on
   weed defection.

DE WEED IDENTIFICATION; DIGITAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
AB Plant species discrimination in mixed plant communities has recently
   become possible using transforms and shape parameters to classify
   digital images. In the present study image analysis techniques were
   used to identify weeds commonly found in winter cereal fields. Those
   species included Veronica hederifolia L., Thlaspi arvense Beauv.,
   Alopecurus myosuroides L., Apera spica-venti L., Poa annua L.,
   Stellaria media L., Capsella bursa-pastoris L., Lamium purpureum L.,
   Matricaria chamomilla L. and Galium aparine L. Images of several growth
   stages of these weeds were photographed using a Still Videokamera,
   binarified, the shape extracted and then Fourier descriptors and shape
   parameter were calculated for each weed. Classified digital images of
   each species were stored on the computer. A separate set of
   photographic images of these 10 weeds were used to test the ability of
   the classified images for plant identification.
   The average rate of correct identification was 81.9 % ranging from 41.6
   % to 100
